"cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
"transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative "
"to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four "
"HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL "
"capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than "
"any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes "
"for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The "
"HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered "
"aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
"1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a "
"lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. "
"It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose. It can also carry "
"additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat "
"performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the "

"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical "
"Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing "
"pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance "
"turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic "

"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be "
"deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 "
"for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max "
"velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well "
"ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in "
"the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar "

"missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The "
"Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-"

"Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the "

"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, "
"does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our "
"people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too "
"limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we "
"face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO "
"code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the "
"Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and "
"bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing "
"paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other "
"forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon "
"nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft "
"extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of "
"cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military "
"airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into "
"international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-"
"efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar "
"at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat "
"manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to "
"engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to "
"catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to "
"the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in "
"its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the "
"restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art "
"targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM "
"(Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, "
"and more.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, "
"and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts into weapons capacity. The "
"Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive "
"Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite "
"thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine "
"nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to "
"dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the "
"Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that "
"implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain "
"effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. "
"It has 2 medium weapon hardpoints.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against "
"extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed "
"by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of "
"the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the "
"aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be "
"measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat "
"encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able "
"to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it "

"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us "

"than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a "
"craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull "
"materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The "
"aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current "
"technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"

"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily "

"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some "
"kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and a sizeable team of "
"aliens in a passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance "
"has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading "

"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo "
"we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship "
"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "
"in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our "
"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"

"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs "

"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some "
"kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and up to 12 aliens in a "
"small passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has "
"observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material "
"and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' "
"theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo "
"we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship "
"is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't "
"manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe "
"will break up easily when hit. This is why a Supply Ship will often be "
"protected by a large screen of Fighter UFOs, in case of interception.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except "
"reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and "
"other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien "
"operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- "
"permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population "
"in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our "
"operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular "
"operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation "
"under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if we can prevent any Supply Ships from reaching an "
"existing alien strongpoint, we may be able to starve it out for a while "
"before sending in troops. This may give us a crucial tactical advantage.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs "
"we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The "
"long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately "
"apparent, but it will show over time.\n"
"\n"
"Because Supply Ships are likely to have escorts, it's recommended that we "
"only engage them with overwhelming force. That's all, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very "

"\n"
"Besides the intelligent computer at its heart, the suite has projectors of "

"equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the "
"very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish "
"out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really "
"belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like "
"aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of "
"this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses "
"exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our "
"interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat "
"will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic "
"loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be "
"suicide.\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to "
"keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and "
"allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be "
"possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other "
"vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant "
"destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the "
"toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, "
"such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow "
"across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the "
"deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, "
"depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our "
"Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft "
"returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and decrease "
"its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range "
"interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far "
"distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour "
"slot on one of our aircraft.\n"

"indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star "
"chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never "

"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so "

"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in "

"field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and "
"composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial "

"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which "
"automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be "
"adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps "
"alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or "
"increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire "
"control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence "
"control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based "
"installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and "
"increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs "
"to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech "
"in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat "
"survivability of our interceptors.\n"

"We achieved what we set out to do: create a continuous wave, deuterium-"
"fluoride-powered laser with megawatt-range output, capable of tracking and "

"The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it "

"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we "
"need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien "
"craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the "
"Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our "
"planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy "
"Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being "
"dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to "
"produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-"
"efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds "
"a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, "
"failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly "
"discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a "
"long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was "
"constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. "
"Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of "
"this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and "
"effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate "
"of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its "
"sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as "
"there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked "
"ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout "
"the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing "
"Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better "
"penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. "
"Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some "
"degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage "
"to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target "
"down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape "
"or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine "
"gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be "
"underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is designed for close-range dogfighting. For this reason, we "
"recommend it should be part of a larger armaments pack that includes longer-"
"range weapons where possible. When closing on an enemy it is extremely "
"deadly, but if it is the only weapon available to a pilot he will be "
"vulnerable during the long approach.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to "
"engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to "
"capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting "
"gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical "
"system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, "
"Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a "
"stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
"carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple "
"application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big "
"particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-"
"powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, "
"but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. "
"The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding "
"particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient "
"velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the "
"focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into "
"a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is "
"far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is "
"intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam "
"to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical "
"system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been "
"destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact "
"in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There "
"is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near "
"the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field "
"right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect "
"against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not "
"be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to "
"cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit "
"as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've "
"rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we "
"can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight "
"electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run "
"it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more "
"research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition "
"will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are "
"within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our "
"Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"This is one of several proposals I'm submitting for the research and "
"development of new laser weaponry. Each of these will have to be developed "
"separately due to the size differences, power levels and complexity of the "
"systems involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Aerial Laser Cannon is the largest and most powerful iteration of our "
"new laser designs. Like our infantry weapons it'll be powered by deuterium-"
"fluoride reaction, but on a much larger scale and amplified by the "
"aircraft's on-board electrical systems. Several exciting ideas are being "
"considered.\n"
"\n"
"As well as being the biggest, this may well be our most challenging laser to "
"create. Any aircraft cannon will have to reach across several kilometres of "
"atmosphere -- and therefore loads of atmospheric blooming -- with enough "
"punch at the endpoint to cut into a UFO's fuselage. Those sorts of power "
"levels have been achieved before with massive arrays mounted on jumbo jets, "
"but never in a package small enough to make a jet fighter cannon.\n"

"ranges well beyond that of the SHIVA cannon, and although damage may be low, "
"we expect that the ability to keep continuous fire and pressure on enemy "

"Commander, we've finished work on the alien missile launcher. It's a fairly "
"simple affair. Firing is computer-driven, fed directly from the UFO's "
"targeting computer. Powerful electromagnetic coils around the launch tube "
"accelerate the missile to extreme speeds, reaching up to Mach 4 at the point "
"where the missile leaves the tube. Only once the missile is fully free of "
"the tube do its onboard rockets kick in.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that we've managed to succesfully adapt fittings, controls "
"and power feeds to allow the Alien Launcher to be safely mounted to our "
"aircraft. The bad news is that we've had to drastically reduce its magazine "
"size in order to meet weight and size restrictions on our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Our aircraft are too small and light to be able to carry so many, and most "

"Commander, I've just finished my report on our latest laser program. We've "
"successfully prototyped the new Aerial Laser Cannon and are ready to put it "
"into production.\n"
"\n"
"We achieved what we set out to do: create a continuous wave, deuterium-"
"fluoride-powered laser with megawatt-range output, capable of tracking and "
"hitting UFOs at ranges of up to 5 kilometres. Accuracy is excellent, "
"hampered only by enemy ECM (Electronic Countermeasures), and unlike in all "
"our other weapons it is not affected by range. The laser proceeds in a "
"straight line and crosses the distance between gun and target almost "
"instantly. It's hard to miss with it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser rapidly "
"loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At maximum range, 5 "
"kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on the same spot to hole "
"a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much time to wait for a kill. "
"The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it "
"strikes a good balance between damage and distance. Average damage per "
"second at these distances is slightly less than the SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but "
"range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so than any of our previous "
"weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for driving and pinning down the "
"enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing up "
"to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are both "
"too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to large off-"
"base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not need to keep "
"laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like to "
"recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our airfleet "
"except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. Anything "
"that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty keeping hold "

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "

"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"
"\n"

"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. "
"Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, "
"they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their "
"minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak "
"the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was "
"wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for "
"'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the "
"shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman"
"\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares "
"that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with "
"confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire "
"and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks "
"almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; "
"visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The "
"subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') "
"is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a "
"thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and "
"so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have "
"carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting "
"part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a "
"total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. "
"It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever "
"they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant "
"life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least "
"we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It "
"has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as "
"sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit "
"the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even "
"permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually "
"caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the "
"supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman "
"fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not "
"enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but "
"prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do "
"the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are "
"badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable "
"to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' "
"appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind "
"of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two "
"different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are "
"very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, "
"and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude "
"more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common "
"origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and "
"can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as "
"soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, "
"positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and "
"advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. "
"This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate "
"manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I "
"couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able "
"to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're "
"seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth "
"a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but "
"then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. "
"It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans, possessing "
"digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this "
"species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely "
"blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to "
"process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to "
"make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. "
"Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain "
"is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet "
"are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a "
"long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the "
"many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the "
"chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, "
"reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from "
"ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of "
"metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have "
"a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find "
"vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to "
"be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap "
"around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and "
"tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in "
"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They seem to wear no armour to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"They sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these "
"tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, "
"omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple "
"but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, "
"however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem "
"to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in "
"lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly "
"comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them "
"or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This "
"allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and "
"their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. "
"However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or "
"electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely "
"effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision "
"capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. "
"The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous "
"alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, "
"unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever "
"the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or "
"skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They "
"are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and "
"should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long "
"as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear "
"to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are "
"unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing "
"them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by "
"the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it "
"does on humans.\n"

"My team and I have completed the disassembly and autopsy of the alien "
"creature we discovered. Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"We first assumed the object was a robot, but upon investigation we found a "
"small biomass at its core. This biological alien core is encased in a shell "
"of sensors which we believe interpret its signals to operate the electrical "
"machinery. For all intents and purposes, this alien is little more than a "
"\"brain\" in charge of a complex device. Calling it a brain may be too "
"generous. We don't believe it is large enough to undertake mental processes "
"more complex than basic motor skills, but troops report seeing it coordinate "
"closely with other aliens on the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself is a small, but heavy, mobile disk, able to hover above "
"the ground. Because of its aerial movement, it is able to cross the "
"battlefield rapidly. Our soldiers will need to take it down before it gets "
"in range, which is no small feat considering its size and movement "
"capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"The models we discovered are equipped with a mounted plasma weapon which is "
"able to fire single rounds. Anyone caught within range will be very sorry. "
"Given its brain size and limited functionality, we believe this alien is "
"engineered for light combat missions -- perhaps it plays a reconnaissance "
"role.\n"
"\n"
"Sincerely,\n"
"\n"
"Dr. Connor"
msgstr ""
"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm "
"hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
"'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature "
"of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, "
"but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to "
"humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
"professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product "
"of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology "
"work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems "
"to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and "
"anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle "
"tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on "
"Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
"without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, "
"but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very "
"well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically "
"conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct "
"electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through "
"digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs "
"underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover "
"products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised "
"air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating "
"inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
"Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. "
"The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the "
"head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we "
"must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory "
"organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
"the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that "
"of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. "
"Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
"battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
"equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
"match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
"their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
"Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
"explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
"extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive "
"organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may "
"have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
"infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
"somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
"down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do "
"not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as "
"technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
"themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
"combat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require "
"further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed "
"analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't "
"seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and it "
"seems to have stuck.\n"
"\n"
"That's all I have for you right now, Commander. I'll contact you again as "
"soon as something new develops.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to "
"combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of "
"battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return "
"to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat "
"effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though "
"it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and "
"the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in "
"the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was "
"later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is "
"thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians "
"and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-"
"century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New "
"materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers "
"tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that "
"PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the "
"past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt "
"at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the "
"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their "
"technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic "
"loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk "
"glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider "

"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk "
"came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that "
"Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. "
"The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high "
"molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and "
"flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and "
"provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 "
"and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after "
"artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new "
"composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The "
"armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it "
"is still in common use today.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared "
"to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to "
"properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, "
"making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental "
"nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the "
"soldier's all-important mobility.\n"

"Commander, we've successfully prototyped our new powered armour. The "
"prototype is waiting in R&D if you'd like to have a go in it yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Our production design is geared towards maximum protection. It is, in a "
"nutshell, an airtight suit of armour with servo-assisted joints and an on-"
"board control system. The outer skin is a flexible three-layer composite, "
"with outer layers consisting of nanotube-fullerene fabric, and an inner "
"layer of special polymer gel, mixed with Wolfram-Molybdene powder. When the "
"outer layer of the composite is burned, the gel evaporates instantly, "
"dissipating the heat, and the metal powder will create a cloud around the "
"damaged area, thus creating a local bloom effect that will consume much of "
"the energy.\n"
"\n"
"The inside consists of a thick layer of memory gel covered by an "
"electrically sensitive lining. The gel allows the suit to be fitted to a "
"range of heights and body shapes, so hopefully we shouldn't have to custom-"
"build every suit to fit one specific soldier. The inner lining is an "
"important part of the control system; it detects nerve impulses through the "
"wearer's skin, interprets these signals, and uses them to predict the "
"wearer's movements before they're made. This allows the suit to move "
"simultaneously with the body rather than resisting the user's movements.\n"
"\n"
"A useful side effect of the memory gel is that it can absorb explosive "
"force, providing better shelter to explosive effects than any of our "
"previous models. Because the suit is entirely sealed, it provides much "
"better protection against environmental hazards such as gas and is effective "
"at dissipating heat, although a wearer can still be roasted inside the suit "
"if he sits in flames long enough. The helmet has built-in sensors to detect "
"flashbangs and cushion the wearer against momentary spikes of light and "
"noise intended to disorient the enemy.\n"
"\n"
"I recommend we get this power armour onto the battlefield as soon as "

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite "
"production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say "
"that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, "
"we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use "
"some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes "
"into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of "
"our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production "
"methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in "
"power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical "
"applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating "
"and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, "
"from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is "
"incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our "
"Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows "
"similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact "
"is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and "
"can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and "
"heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as "
"well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version "
"of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. "
"Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact "
"alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we "
"already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are "
"honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery "
"needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best "
"to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the "
"soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to "
"be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to "
"resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close "
"assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Commander, the weaponry the aliens are fielding in battle is growing more "

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting "
"realisations. Obviously, the key to creating more effective mobile armour "
"based on the alien suits lies in the direction of nanocomposites. This will "
"require large amounts of carbon nanotubes.\n"
"\n"
"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, "
"and trying to work them into a proper shape was even worse. Because of this "
"nanocomposite armour has never been used except in high-cost vehicles such "
"as aircraft and tanks, and then only in plating that requires minimal "
"shaping or other work. The alien armour, however, uses carbon nanotube "
"composites in abundance. It's our manufacturing processes that are holding "
"us back.\n"
"\n"
"With the alien armour in hand and enough resources at our disposal, I "
"believe that we can devise new production methods and shaping processes that "
"will allow us to mass-produce shaped nanocomposite plates, finally bringing "
"this technology into our reach.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a "
"composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, "
"the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-"
"acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or "
"'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, "
"one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively "
"little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of "
"mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most "
"expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that "
"stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. "
"The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a "
"bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very "
"effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force "
"across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid "
"fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching "
"any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs "
"very well against plasma. This makes sense. It is their weapon of choice and "
"we would expect them to know how to protect against it. Because plasma "
"weaponry appears to have limited penetration capabilities, the armour is "
"able to disperse the heat before it can melt through the protective layers.\n"
"\n"
"The armour also performs pretty well against ordinary bullets and "
"explosives, although it's not very effective against incendiary devices or "
"flamethrowers. These weapons raise the atmospheric temperature around the "
"wearer so that there is no place to dump the heat, effectively roasting the "
"wearer inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, "
"allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into "
"the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively "
"applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses "
"for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the "
"differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials "
"involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to "
"investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour "
"using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll permit me, I'd like to raise a final issue with you, Commander. "
"One of my researchers has toyed with a personal laser project over the last "
"couple of months. While we were testing the alien armour, we allowed him to "
"experiment with it in his downtime and we were astonished by the results. "
"The relatively weak laser beam was hardly reduced as it passed through the "
"armor.\n"
"\n"
"I know that we've long believed that effective man-portable laser weaponry "
"is just a myth, but these suprise findings have reinvigorated my team. I'm "
"hearing all sorts of interesting proposals. This armour will seriously dent "
"our ability to use the aliens' plasma weaponry against them on the "
"battlefield. If we could use lasers to pack a reasonable punch into a hand-"
"held rifle, it could be the best response to their armor.\n"

"\n"
"PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
"\n"
"Research Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 16 February 1958\n"
"\n"
"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations "
"Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a "
"time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important "
"part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation "
"chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the "
"other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could "
"comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep "
"extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere "
"generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired "
"mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least "
"several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our "
"research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may "
"be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment "
"to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere "
"generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in "
"each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other "
"chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer "
"electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic "
"button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for "
"every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the "
"contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially "
"designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The "
"facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples "
"for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full "
"extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to "
"examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the "
"discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn "
"their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for "
"communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once "
"and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be "
"given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless "
"there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking "
"EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is "
"another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war "
"with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind "
"that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of "
"PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an "
"extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to "
"perform up to its design spec."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. "
"It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel "
"to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow "
"easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is "
"built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. "
"Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-"
"absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in "
"any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain "
"access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and "
"should be placed at a considered distance to the Command Centre so that on-"
"duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity without putting "
"the CC at risk.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be "
"assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more "
"tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains "
"nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to "
"destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick "
"and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over "
"the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while "
"countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the "
"start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the "
"attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the "
"aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air "
"Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from "
"batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. "
"Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-"
"mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in "
"acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a "
"hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is "
"miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough "
"study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened "
"is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other "
"incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its "
"target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply "
"need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some "
"old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our "
"results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when "
"engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This "
"is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an "
"airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless "
"of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on "
"the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but "
"in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics "
"suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the "
"numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has "
"agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no "
"cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage "
"any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack "
"the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting "
"our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of "
"the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to "
"completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage "
"them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or "
"later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is "
"designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no "
"longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a "
"follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because "
"while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to "
"enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous "
"effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support "
"equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid "
"deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house "
"and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to "
"review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "
"target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the "
"dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base "
"attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be "
"engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the "
"advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable "
"tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship "
"could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as "

"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-"
"injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced "
"facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has "
"available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai "
"hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific "
"bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better "
"prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the "
"coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and "
"contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to "
"completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of "
"Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected "
"to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We "
"are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and "
"regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself "
"through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical "
"nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. "
"Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full "
"health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury "
"counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. "
"Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military "
"sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes "
"and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at "
"the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford "

"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a "
"complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL "
"(Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has "
"eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar "
"facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Small Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 small "
"VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in "
"complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's "
"time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large "
"hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can "
"safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- "
"once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the "
"aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently "
"adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly "
"line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the "
"undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs "
"to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a "
"pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Large Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously the Small Hangar cannot house large craft due to size "
"considerations.\n"

"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, "
"maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct "
"connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any "
"extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with "
"volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. "
"Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting "

"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US "

"nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly "
"studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that "
"can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing "
"and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion "
"chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation "
"or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can "
"build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are "
"also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a "
"moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of "
"all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain "
"one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat "
"any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To "
"do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since "
"the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to "
"constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like "
"hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely "
"dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. "
"It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical "
"autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy "
"research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very "
"efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor "
"that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead "
"it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle "
"accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power "
"to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is "
"redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output "
"will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. "
"By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in "
"nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and "
"700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is "
"particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor "
"integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the "
"HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of "
"radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a "
"special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant "
"tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects "
"against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely "
"lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs "
"I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand "
"the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet "
"the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy "
"buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a "
"subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to "
"properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for "
"a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with "
"every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many "
"facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with "
"exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities "
"working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the "
"power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too "
"much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down "
"the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to "
"get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any "
"energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even "
"hangar lifts.\n"

"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX "

"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, "
"bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. "
"Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel "
"effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of "

"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/"

"sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition "
"designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can "
"take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and "

"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility "
"designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so "
"I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a "
"control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground "
"around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each "

"coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than "
"simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. "
"Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser "

"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the "

"from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be "
"present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a "
"radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a "
"mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software "
"intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the "
"extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as "
"effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range "
"is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further "
"installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-"
"reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan "
"and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log "
"their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various "

"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is "

"our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under "
"any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes "

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for "
"later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is "
"based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from "
"alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer "
"shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a "
"heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment "
"measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. "
"In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system "
"which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The "
"facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with "
"tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-"
"retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to "
"contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but "
"that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the "
"entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter "
"Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN "
"nuclear site register. At full capacity -- 10 grammes of antimatter -- just "
"one storage facility will be containing the equivalent of nearly half a "
"megaton of TNT. While this isn't much compared to modern thermonuclear "
"weapons, it's enough to turn the entire base and everything inside to "
"cinders in less than a second. It's difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but "

"The Asian Republic:\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its "
"old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, "
"including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between "
"independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and "
"respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side "
"throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new "
"Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist "
"government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new "
"council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off "
"to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel "
"nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for "
"greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be "
"disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary "
"historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese "
"researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the "
"world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly "
"joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour "
"its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging "
"economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The "
"Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still "
"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"

"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "
"state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world "
"superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister "
"Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While "
"the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about "
"who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own "
"problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, "
"which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. "
"Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya "
"could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it "
"did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the "
"Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in "
"Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter "
"conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power "
"plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, "
"safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from "
"enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian "
"plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new "
"type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of "
"the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and "
"from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear "
"revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted "
"element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's "
"waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The "
"Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission "
"became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the "
"world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the "
"example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power "
"generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The "
"nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and "
"commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the "
"country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether "
"under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat "
"antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it "
"does not lack for manpower.\n"

"The Commonwealth of Oceania:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the "
"countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into "
"the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when "
"joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and "
"burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own "
"parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, "
"they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in "
"military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had "
"trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the "
"Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian "
"military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the "
"country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several "
"South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the "
"Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the "
"surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated "
"the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the "
"country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines "
"were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless "
"parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small "
"regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the "
"vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the "
"Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one "
"great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the "
"Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships "
"passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was "
"free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. "
"Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth "
"seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their "
"full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of "
"Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-"
"Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and "
"Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still "
"can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its "
"own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is "
"minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves "
"only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, "

"The Asian Republic:\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its "
"old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, "
"including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between "
"independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and "
"respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side "
"throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new "
"Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist "
"government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new "
"council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off "
"to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel "
"nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for "
"greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be "
"disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary "
"historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese "
"researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the "
"world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly "
"joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour "
"its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging "
"economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The "
"Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still "
"fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its "
"member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it "
"can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-"
"east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the "
"commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong "
"and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other "
"country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in "
"South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic "
"death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations "
"away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework "
"already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people "
"could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave "
"proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the "
"Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. "
"The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone "
"could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it "
"went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for "
"the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, "
"trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash "
"in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. "
"Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no "
"friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by "
"elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they "
"encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed "
"Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the "
"continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of "
"arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, "
"and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known "
"as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government "
"represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut "
"surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but "
"has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more "
"people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, "
"ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented "
"depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the "
"international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal "
"reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military "
"arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its "
"interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury "
"goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional "
"spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the "
"post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches "
"anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-"
"functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the "
"beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from "
"Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and "
"wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number "
"of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most "
"unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate "
"Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two "
"recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, "
"a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the "
"country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to "
"reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public "
"votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support "
"for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in "
"Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United "
"America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space "
"industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few "
"stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards "
"of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has "
"the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of "
"commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of "
"goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less "
"than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. "
"It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by "
"the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can "
"turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and "
"further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when "
"it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both "
"Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were "
"also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU "
"expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU "
"passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of "
"church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially "
"recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the "
"Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing "
"culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they "
"were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United "
"States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were "
"fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to "
"political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, "
"Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but "
"reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the "
"defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the "
"EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the "
"forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second "
"the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United "
"Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion "
"and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's "
"efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's "
"nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it "
"was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. "
"However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who "
"don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its "
"military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual "
"army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military "
"cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts "
"of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only "
"ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their "
"'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and "
"there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, "
"including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western "
"influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- "
"Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more "
"than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under "
"the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was "
"no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with "
"an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly "
"even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan "
"and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard "
"themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance "
"not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. "
"Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the "
"entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to "
"crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto "
"the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most "
"of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. "
"Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-"
"East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. "
"This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the "
"Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent "
"worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, "
"Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. "
"The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in "
"its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma "
"and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by "
"individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their "
"personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do "
"not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is "
"tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 "
"few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite "
"and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of "
"engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause "
"for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of "
"criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained "
"this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in "
"separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, "
"as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and "
"atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations "
"undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels "
"and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various "
"measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it "
"accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined "
"by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, "
"and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking "
"down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most "
"advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined "
"territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It "
"also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core "
"of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception "
"of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern "
"Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-"
"America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and "
"communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the "
"next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its "
"borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire "
"for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public "
"health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new "
"exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and "
"exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent "
"possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa "
"forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but "
"it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops "
"are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-"
"old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due "
"to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most "
"of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with "
"one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat "
"poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the "
"ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an "
"open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the "
"constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of "

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art "
"equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to "
"combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of "
"Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of "
"UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion "
"plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear "
"power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in "
"the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these "
"hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could "
"America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest "
"levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding "
"allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the "
"construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert "
"somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named "
"\"PHALANX 태평양 작전본부\", loaded with state-of-the-art equipment, and "
"staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to combat an "
"extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-"
"breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world "
"had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian "
"contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of "
"yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a "
"reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that "
"never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military "
"spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, "
"who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite "
"repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the "
"outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue "
"only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to "
"keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the "
"budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some "
"new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the "
"opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but "

"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"New information has come to light that you need to see. We've discovered a "
"commonality that may give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered "
"some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained "
"sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the "
"problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, "
"again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for "
"storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I "
"spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found "
"the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our "
"blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be "
"found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed "
"that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. "
"The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge "
"numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for "
"each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. "
"Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of "
"chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its "
"source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no "
"variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to "
"believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in "
"part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
"infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests "
"on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. "
"The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or "
"positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are "
"essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism "
"requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a "
"parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a "
"complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it "
"acts and replicates exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is "
"warranted. As each alien species carries a unique strand of the infection, "
"we have given them alphabetical designations after the source species in "
"which the strand can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so "
"forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only "
"thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. "
"We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit "
"each species, perhaps something that allows them to coexist the way they "
"do.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious to humans. When "
"injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed "
"the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, "
"however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard "
"human T cells. The organism was unable to take root in the face of our "
"immune system.\n"
"\n"
"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers "
"on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated "
"about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our personnel is "
"in progress, just in case, and strict quarantine procedures will be "
"maintained throughout the lab.\n"

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien "
"autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our "
"conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien "
"larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an "
"alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-"
"sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, "
"from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned "
"out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the "
"aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. "
"Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all "
"with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is "
"either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing "
"only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. "
"Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical "
"to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into "
"hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the "
"subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side "
"of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These "
"tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, "
"functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism "
"is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful "
"to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks "
"are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's "
"neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data "
"on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we "
"believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment "
"unit. A few of the mixtures in the device are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, "
"very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all "
"of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of "
"our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. "
"Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force "
"these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can "
"now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- "
"they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This "
"usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be "
"afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our "
"ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. "
"Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have "
"learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign "
"language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and "
"instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign "
"language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on "
"trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been "
"easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical "
"encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The "
"casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to "
"have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or "
"even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical "
"differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This "
"indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared "
"consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it "
"merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from "
"our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share "
"one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means "
"of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an "
"indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and "
"breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even "
"specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens "
"will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various "
"species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate "
"with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign "
"language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep "
"conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own "
"body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain "
"really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not "
"part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien "
"homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission "
"to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to "
"distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to "
"tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would "
"like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more "
"effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a "
"healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to "
"maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would "
"be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"As you're aware, we are facing an increasingly worsening threat from the XVI "

"\n"
"Dealing with these bases has to be one of our top priorities. I recommend we "

"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities "
"anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The "
"region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars "
"and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the "
"stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have "
"been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There "
"has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various "
"base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar "
"system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien "
"activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we "
"have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien "
"movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind "
"Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if "
"they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough "
"eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll "
"find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and "
"cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct "
"control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar "
"system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that "
"we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned "
"every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With "
"these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection "
"coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. "
"The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' "
"-- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We "
"have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no "
"way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the "
"following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding "
"where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of "
"how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If "
"the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering "
"UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this "
"issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like "
"crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we "
"needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got "
"our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon "
"watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally "
"managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible "
"and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into "
"existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited "
"its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology "
"that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have "
"strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a "
"burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the "
"slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 "
"klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not "
"need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel "
"that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive "
"allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our "
"detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly "
"violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or "
"special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we "
"have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may "
"study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not "
"be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- "
"just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs "
"and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. "
"It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting "

"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever "
"built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate "

"channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO "
"extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing "
"it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system "
"continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to "
"keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used "
"to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but "
"even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If "
"a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a "
"gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the "
"Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as "
"possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to "
"jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on "
"the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of "
"the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion "
"represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is "
"that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, "
"regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is "
"largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of "
"radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation "
"detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in "
"air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be "
"impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, "
"every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at "
"high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is "
"quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a "
"memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a "
"more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a "
"more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher "
"than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far "
"more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"

"Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After "
"some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use "
"the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', "
"remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are "
"given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by "
"two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to "
"make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better "
"lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-"
"voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will "
"deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the "
"current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape "
"or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced "
"shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with "
"these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the "
"operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop "
"a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take "
"years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build "
"things we could never have attempted before.\n"
"\n"
"Alien Materials should now be available for use in production. "
"Unfortunately, they require a lot of rare and expensive components, some of "
"which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we "
"could obtain the materials needed in quantities that would make non-trivial "
"production possible. We'll have to salvage what we need off the aliens, "
"because we won't be able to produce any of it for the forseeable future.\n"

"Eisenhower, our Director of Administration. He's been away on business to "
"the UN since last week, but we ran an older sample which has come up "
"positive. We don't know when or how he was subverted or if he even joined "
"PHALANX with honourable intentions, but it's clear he has acted as an alien "
"spy for some weeks. Unfortunately we can't seem to find him at any of the "
"locations he was scheduled to visit. Internal Security has taken charge of "
"his workstation and is in the process of information control.\n"
"\n"
"Things are a bit hectic right now. Dr. Eisenhower's infection implies that "
"other members of a hive mind -- human or alien -- were in close enough "
"proximity to allow him to function at human intelligence. He could have "
"linked up with our subjects in Containment, or a nearby alien cell, or even "
"other infiltrators inside our base. Right now, we don't know. Quarantine "
"procedures have been tightened to the absolute maximum, and we're rushing "
"another full batch of tests on all our personnel. We're all frightened down "
"here in DivBio. My assistant has been jumping at shadows all day.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, our attempts to infect other terrestrial life -- even "
"intelligent vertebrates such as bottlenose dolphins and elephants -- have "
"failed completely. This organism must have been engineered wholly or in part "
"to specifically infect the human species.\n"
"\n"
"We've dubbed the organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. "
"This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a "
"complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it "
"acts and replicates exactly like one.\n"
"\n"
"Really, what we're looking at here is a bio-weapon of unprecedented "
"proportions. Instead of killing its victims it takes control of them with no "
"option of resistance and -- at the moment -- no available cure or defence. "
"The most humble and harmless civilian can be infected and, with the instant "
"shared expertise of the larger hive mind, become an effective warrior for "
"the aliens while reducing our numbers. When the aliens also supply them with "
"weapons, we can see the true face of horror.\n"
"\n"
"I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish scenario for us. Our troops will "
"undoubtedly be coming up against more and more human opponents during alien "
"attacks on Earth. We may even find people crewing UFOs for the aliens. It's "
"madness.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we must develop a vaccine against XVI as soon as possible. The "
"danger of our soldiers and salvage technicians falling victim to the "
"infection in the field is too great to ignore even for a moment, let alone "
"allowing the general population to fall prey to this abomination. I hereby "
"request your permission to start work on a vaccine immediately. Please, "

"\n"
"The most striking characteristic we've seen of the invasion is that the "

"their own nebulous purposes. They do this in a rather gruesome manner that "
"shows no respect for life; they cut up human beings as if butchering cattle, "
"and their Bloodspiders will simply dissect someone on the spot for a "

"\n"
"We can only assume that they use the samples they're gathering in some kind "
"of research program, studies into our physiology and perhaps our psychology "
"and culture as well. We don't know the reasons behind this, but it's an "
"interesting point. They are trying to learn something about us, and they "
"don't care how we feel about it. To them, we're merely objects to be "
"studied.\n"
"\n"
"Of further interest are their main targets. Until recently alien activity "
"reports came almost exclusively from high-density population centres with "
"easy landing access for UFOs, which ties in with the general objective of "
"capturing human research material. However, as of late the focus of the "
"campaign seems to have shifted or narrowed. Activity around hospitals, blood "
"banks and bio-research laboratories has been noticed more and more "
"frequently in addition to the usual raids on population centres. The "
"activity has ranged from low-key infiltration for unknown purposes up to "
"full-scale assaults on high-security labs. We're not sure yet what this "
"shift could mean, but we are making recommendations to the UN to sharpen "
"security in these facilities and arm local forces to stand up to alien "
"attack. We've marked up a list of high-risk targets for rapid police "
"response and are distributing handbooks on anti-alien tactics. More "
"investigation into the change of targets is underway.\n"
"\n"
"As always, there is a lot more alien activity going on outside of our "

"research into the aliens' strategy. We expect that these techniques will "
"allow us to catch an estimated 10% of alien activity (out of total estimated "
"activity on Earth) that would have previously gone unreported.\n"

"problems finding and tracking the elusive larger craft we've observed. After "
"reviewing radar, lidar and video recordings made from observatories on the "

"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the "
"initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, "
"and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of "
"volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which "
"are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly "
"exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an "
"instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid "
"does come under attack, comms between PHALANX Command Centres and assets in "
"the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying "
"items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is "
"nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer "
"under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at "
"all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've "
"fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-"
"planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are "
"years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane "
"in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at "
"our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are "
"nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too "
"destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever "
"managed to score a hit. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into "
"extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that "
"has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're "
"going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, "
"but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are "
"starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is "
"to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency "
"to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our "
"extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base "
"colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with "
"enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library "
"of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns "
"into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. "
"We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to "
"lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built "
"into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in "
"front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on "
"the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling "
"block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in "
"order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its "
"own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the "
"UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- "
"to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, "
"heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely "
"necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"
"\n"
"As you see, Sir, these problems can all be overcome, but we need to do some "
"serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please "
"lend your authorisation as soon as is feasible.\n"

"\n"
"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX orbital gun is tested and ready to rock. We have six shots. All "
"we need now is a target and your authorisation.\n"
"\n"
"For my full report:\n"
"\n"
"We've finally carried out all the gun enhancements I mentioned. I'm sorry "
"the work on the gun took so long, but we had to tear out all their old "
"capacitor banks and replace them with military-grade capacitors of the same "
"size. Then we had to put down new rails since the old ones were just too "
"worn-out. Still, it was worth it.\n"
"\n"
"Work on our new impact vehicle has also been completed. Over the course of "
"the development process we decided to ditch the concept of an artillery "
"shell, and are now referring to the impact vehicle as the 'Dragon' Space "
"Missile. It's a semi-independent tracking missile, connected to our Command "
"Centre by a laser beam, and guided by three systems at once: a beam rider, a "
"huge infrared tracking array, and a manual adjustment interface in the "
"Command Centre. We can plot the missile's course accurately to a circle less "
"than a centimetre in diameter.\n"
"\n"
"The UN has reluctantly allowed us to use the 3-kiloton mini-nuclear warheads "
"we were pushing for, removing a lot of our concerns and limitations. With "
"this warhead on board, it doesn't matter how hard or softly we hit a UFO. If "
"it's hit, it's coming down.\n"
"\n"
"The missile is able to adjust its own trajectory in and out of atmosphere. "
"It's about the width of a VW Beetle and should inflict severe damage to any "
"Carrier UFO it hits; hopefully enough to cause a crash, or at least knock it "
"far enough down into the atmosphere to be engaged by our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"We should be able to fire several shots before the UFO can withdraw out of "
"range or provide return fire to the gun. However, one way or another it's "
"likely that the UFO will identify the target and attempt to destroy it from "
"orbit. All personnel and vital equipment have already been evacuated.\n"
"\n"
"We may lose the gun, but what we stand to gain is immeasurable. Technology "
"that represents a fighting chance for humanity in this war. Nothing the "
"aliens have left on Earth has ever been so important.\n"
"\n"
"There's an alien FTL drive somewhere up there, Sir, and I mean to get my "
"hands on it.\n"
"\n"
"The gun is ready to fire at your say-so. I'll let you know as soon as "
"there's a target in range.\n"

"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. "
"This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought "
"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the "
"shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-"
"designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic molecules "
"before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced regularly, but we've designed the system to "

"into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium "
"reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. "
"These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, "
"generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs "
"the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement "
"by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our "
"custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or "
"radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back "
"into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the "
"system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow "
"damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop "
"functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
"beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
"production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
"required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied "
"to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new "
"proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in "
"World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder "
"and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared "
"to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing "
"trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much "
"less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military "
"use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by "
"the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from "
"Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, "
"reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the "
"materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new "
"powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the "
"late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's "
"designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person "
"inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol "
"round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round "
"detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent "
"penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to "
"military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern "
"ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping "
"power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the "
"problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit "
"on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed "
"minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, "
"especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour "
"can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and "
"the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the "
"combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to "
"new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at "
"such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, "
"though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already "
"minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is "
"outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its "
"advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, "
"it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who "
"do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
"advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
"size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
"magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
"overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
"caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-"
"piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform "
"well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range "
"firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle "
"has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged "
"construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It "
"is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and "
"replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and "
"relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can "
"entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay "
"down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges "
"than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the "
"end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be "
"able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a "
"good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and "
"is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons "
"which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban "
"building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers "
"either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the "
"others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they "
"should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring "
"their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the "
"advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to "
"fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built "
"weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the "
"Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service "
"throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in "
"2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and "
"ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from "

"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. "
"Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum "
"magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, "
"but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process "
"for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums "

"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful "
"recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve "
"accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a "
"sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine "
"to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and "
"performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive "
"fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the "
"terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the "
"latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use "
"by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking "
"technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the "
"specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun "
"barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or "
"flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can "
"change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. "
"The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of "
"shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any "
"kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire "
"flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel "
"needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior "
"accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The "
"flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in "
"impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks "
"are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other "
"types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and "
"the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the "
"most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the "
"CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a "
"good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as "
"the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective "
"at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer "
"a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. "
"Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very "
"effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
"has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, "
"it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro "
"Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"셰트 탄피입니다. 각 탄피는 8개의 자그마한 플레셰트들을 -- 지느러미들이 달려 "

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in "

"We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other "
"existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to "
"explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a "
"coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally "
"poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force "
"to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. "
"The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field "
"between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field "
"is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the "
"projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, "
"thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of "
"stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The "
"electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact "
"in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to "
"create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant "
"firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility "
"to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along "
"them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current "
"cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes "
"successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at "
"least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading "
"new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has "
"been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to "
"conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, "
"individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. "
"This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to "
"sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel "
"have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the "
"soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and "
"slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series "
"of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped "
"from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent "
"armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. "
"The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their "
"actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, "
"with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each "
"reload) and a small ammo capacity. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping "
"power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It is one of "

"This is a 200mm canister of high-pressure flammable gas, locked and secured "

"flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, creates a slow "
"thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a fuel-air explosion "
"-- that can roast living tissue in seconds. Its range is limited, as the C90 "
"must be quickly ignited before it disperses, but it inflicts horrific damage "
"on organic targets that few weapons can hope to match. The heat generated by "
"C90 exceeds 1700 degrees celsius, enough to melt titanium, but due to its "
"gaseous nature it leaves no burning residue (like napalm) and disperses heat "
"much more quickly. This makes it significantly safer for urban use than "

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a "
"deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of "
"effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In "
"fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired "
"balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before "
"the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an "
"excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, "
"especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, "
"we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they "
"do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time "
"after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say "
"exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to "
"alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our "
"soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the "
"alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are "
"applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential "
"of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate "
"flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he "
"will have very little warning and in most cases will require special "
"training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no "
"prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine "
"against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang "
"and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his "
"weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"
"The flashbang's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. It has served with "
"distinction in many wars before this one, and it will continue to do so "
"until all its functions can be replaced somehow by a new system.\n"

"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of "

"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes. When fired in Impact mode, the grenades will "
"explode as soon as they hit something -- a wall or the target. They'll also "
"explode the moment they reach their target destination, a nice way to ensure "
"the grenade will explode near to where the soldier is aiming it.\n"
"\n"
"But it also has a Timer mode. When fired this way, the grenades will "
"detonate several seconds after leaving the barrel regardless of what happens "
"in those seconds. This is great for bouncing a grenade around a corner or "
"firing a long shot, but it is harder to be precise.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received "
"numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. "
"It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of "
"its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of "
"compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary "
"cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept "
"reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, "
"but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do "
"exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a "
"set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate "
"grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's "
"maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can "
"rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round "
"bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) "
"grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to "
"generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. "
"Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would "
"be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on "
"explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on "
"fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While "
"not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and "
"infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification "
"HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and "
"range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for "
"special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as "
"effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, "
"different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some "
"range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. "
"The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an "
"uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before "
"detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades "
"exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator "
"failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot "
"with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around "
"corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have "
"trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator "
"doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the "
"blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left "
"of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a "
"severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations "
"where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly "
"discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm "
"-- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells "
"similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun "
"shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in "
"close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the "
"operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few "
"standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for "
"your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat "
"knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it "
"is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and "
"contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for "
"our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the "
"blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate "
"the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though "
"perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too "
"large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, "
"tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule "
"wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, "
"long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- "
"that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a "
"purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on "
"Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling "
"tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of "
"the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from "
"Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were "
"doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut "
"up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The "
"large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar "

"\n"
"The more powerful electrical systems and laser equipment have increased size "
"and weight considerably compared to the stun rod, putting the electrolaser "
"firmly in the Heavy Weapons category. Like all laser-based weapons it's "
"affected by rain, fog, smoke and other conditions that thicken the air or "
"release particles into it. Like all electric weapons, firing at airborne "
"targets will produce limited results, unless they're close enough to an "
"earthed object to allow the electricity to arc between them. In addition, "
"any electrolaser needs the right kind of atmosphere to be able to create a "
"plasma channel; taking them off of Earth could render them useless.\n"
"\n"
"Another, more practical issue is the power unit. We couldn't quite achieve "
"the desired power output profile using our standard deuterium-fluoride "
"cartridges, so we've had to make adjustments to the ammunition package "
"itself. I'm afraid this means that ammunition for the electrolaser is NOT "
"interchangeable with ammunition for our regular laser weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, no matter what the drawbacks might be, performance is light-years "
"ahead of Dr. Connor's stun rod. I highly recommend we replace all stun rods "
"currently in use with electrolasers as soon as humanly possible. For the "
"sake of our troops, if nothing else.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic "
"Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile "
"situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could "
"handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends "
"being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics "
"would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some "
"futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the "
"wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months "
"at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but "
"it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can "
"contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate "
"aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and "
"easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with "
"minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via "
"directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, "
"measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's "
"combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a "
"small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). "
"All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly "
"to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can "
"deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency "
"operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most "
"importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese "
"researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost "
"unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which "
"can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly "
"sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator "
"about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up "
"bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair "
"nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once "
"their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often "
"not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of "
"nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised "
"with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever "
"made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is "
"required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in "
"a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions "
"for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's "
"as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an "
"ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I "
"recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds "
"should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to "
"the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from "
"the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a "
"comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious "
"soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from "
"the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from "
"a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching "
"targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but "
"please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's "
"life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will "
"take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma "
"while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we "
"can make it.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Medikits come with three prepared treatment capabilities. Apply First Aid "
"will treat a soldier's wounds, stemming the blood loss of a wound in an "
"effort to keep them alive. It will restore a small amount of health, but "
"soldiers will need to recover back at base.\n"
"\n"
"Stimulants can be used to revive a soldier who has fallen unconcious as a "
"result of being stunned or gassed.\n"
"\n"
"Antipsychotics will provide an injection of endorphins. Many desperate "
"commanders have found it useful to boost morale during highly stressful "
"engagements."

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled "
"version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell "
"you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal "
"defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is "
"remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning "
"through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma "
"shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at "
"distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-"
"purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other "
"close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and "
"they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the "
"plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of "
"automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- "
"approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but "
"it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three "
"solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or "
"medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for "
"field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for "
"war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed "
"conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they "
"invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth "

"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
"rifle, but an unusual one. Like a machine gun, it is designed to saturate a "
"target with projectiles, but it takes this concept much further. It vomits "
"out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
"easily tear apart a target.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, "
"hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute "
"into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for "
"as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike "
"bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to "
"target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low "
"in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing. They are easily "
"knocked off course for the same reason, but so many needles are put down "
"range that even distant shots are likely to make some contact with the "
"enemy.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
"electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
"coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too "
"energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made "
"it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We "
"may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research. I've "
"put a new research proposal in your queue along these lines.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler's electromagnet array makes it much heavier than the average "
"rifle, which could reduce the effectiveness of some of our troops. But given "
"its deadly power, I'm sure more than a few of our boys will gladly shed some "
"other equipment to carry the Needler into battle.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "

"Combining an alien-inspired power pack and coil arrangement with some of our "

"it's made from materials never before seen on Earth. Discarding sabot rounds "
"are normally used for much larger calibres -- we've effectively scaled down "

"higher than any other weapon we have. In fact, the Coilgun is now the "
"highest-calibre infantry weapon on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"Of course we've had to make some sacrifices -- high weight due to the coils "

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "

"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "

"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a "
"favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the "
"world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight "
"construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant "
"competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-"
"wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-"
"automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there "
"is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new "
"threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a "
"folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal "
"with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it "
"accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight "
"urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also "
"more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster "
"with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon "
"is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs "
"in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much "
"faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short "
"shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It "
"cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for "

"shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so "
"that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one "

"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
"technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
"Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical "
"weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three "
"battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting "
"significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that "
"we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
"Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
"record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed "
"to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
"that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
"especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at "
"knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
"chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the "
"most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first "
"prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese "
"government. Production models were only trickling into government units by "
"the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to "
"respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew "
"through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version "
"of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with "
"aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally "
"through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round "
"at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of "
"SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next "
"decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can "
"suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of "
"lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before "
"the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly "
"50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known "
"design flaw.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification "
"CRC-8.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very "

"\n"
"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long "
"Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their "
"principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles "
"developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' "
"meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to "
"reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine "

"kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an "
"intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of "
"an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows repeated shots without losing "
"control.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its "
"incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class "
"that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-"
"reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium "
"alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity "
"powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the "
"LRWS is not as effective at very great distance, but for a PHALANX squad's "
"typical short-range skirmishing, this should not become a problem.\n"
"\n"
"The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. "
"Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than "
"any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the "
"LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1 should keep their distance, fire from cover, "
"and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic "
"weapon; it is too unwieldy to fire off quick snap shots with any accuracy. "
"Marksmen should assume a crouched firing position for extra stability "
"whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or "
"the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a "
"sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no "
"circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close "
"range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will "
"quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to "
"shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and "

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of "
"the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious "
"escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that "
"the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it "
"was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a "
"complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue "
"that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking "
"about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons "
"themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of "
"magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the "
"particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. "
"I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', "
"until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of "
"mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that "
"we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds "
"particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter "
"of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles "
"are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they "
"are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this "
"complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest "
"of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to "
"duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and "
"they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're "
"going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little "
"accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, "
"and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo "
"supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the "
"field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they "
"obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and "
"mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude "
"greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers "
"and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. "
"It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't "
"matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to "
"take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. "
"Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious "
"about this war.\n"

#~ "This is an extremely urgent report, please believe me when I say it "
#~ "cannot wait for anything.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I've found some disturbing new information during our continued research "
#~ "into the XVI organism. I have reason to believe that XVI may be an even "
#~ "larger part of the alien plan than we first suspected.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "First, some background. During our initial analyses of the aliens' "
#~ "cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA "
#~ "replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We "
#~ "initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to "
#~ "appear with unerring regularity. The same result, again and again; every "
#~ "time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have "
#~ "difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. It didn't make "
#~ "any sense until our recent discovery of the XVI infection in civilian "
#~ "people. I immediately suspected a correlation but wanted to wait until I "
#~ "could prove it, and since then I've spent most of my off hours studying "
#~ "the problem. Now I believe I've found the cause -- XVI itself.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "I've determined that all the aliens carry their own versions of this same "
#~ "micro-organic infection. There are differences to account for the "
#~ "different bodies and blood types -- some of these varieties don't appear "
#~ "to live in blood at all -- but it is unmistakably the same thing. We can "
#~ "only assume that the different strands of the infection were engineered "
#~ "to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Since all the alien species carry a unique strand of the infection, I've "
#~ "decided to modify our naming conventions slightly, giving individual XVI "
#~ "strands alphabetical designations after the source in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Humans have XVI-H, Tamans have XVI-T, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The organism's function is not readily apparent in these aliens since we "
#~ "have no uninfected control specimens against which we can measure the "
#~ "effect. However, given this information, we have to conclude that XVI is "
#~ "more than simply a bio-weapon against humanity. It may even be used in a "
#~ "similar way -- an enslavement device suppressing individual thought and "
#~ "linking the subject into the group mind, whether there is a group or not. "
#~ "Perhaps the aliens that are sent to Earth are all members of some sort of "
#~ "slave soldier caste, or even prisoners forced to fight, like the Red "
#~ "Army's convict battalions in World War 2. At this point we can barely "
#~ "begin to speculate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I think we should pursue aggressive investigation into XVI so "
#~ "that we can find the truth behind some of these mysteries. We have to "
#~ "determine the true purpose of this organism, what it means to the war and "
#~ "to us as a species. XVI-H is possibly the biggest threat we've ever "
#~ "faced.\n"

#~ "New information has come to light during the last batch of autopsies you "
#~ "requested. Our reports stand, but we've discovered a commonality that may "
#~ "give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we "
#~ "encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due "
#~ "to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human "
#~ "error, but the problem has continued to appear with surprising "
#~ "regularity. The same result, again and again; every time we run a sample "
#~ "that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have difficulty extracting a "
#~ "single uncontaminated sequence. I spent some of my off hours studying the "
#~ "problem, and I believe I've found the cause.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in "
#~ "our blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences "
#~ "can be found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has "
#~ "confirmed that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species "
#~ "we've recovered. The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular "
#~ "organism present in huge numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are "
#~ "several versions of it, one for each species of alien, and they all share "
#~ "remarkable DNA similarities. Interestingly, although these organisms all "
#~ "have an identical number of chromosomes, none of them can survive in a "
#~ "body that is not a member of its source species. Also curious is the fact "
#~ "that there are absolutely no variations in DNA between organisms of the "
#~ "same version. This leads us to believe that the different versions may "
#~ "have been engineered -- wholly or in part -- to suit the individual "
#~ "species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic "
#~ "infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run "
#~ "tests on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control "
#~ "specimens. The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative "
#~ "effects -- or positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's "
#~ "presence. They are essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. "
#~ "Since the organism requires a living host for its own survival, it seems "
#~ "to be either a parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved "
#~ "benefits.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or "
#~ "XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is "
#~ "far more complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates "
#~ "exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien "
#~ "species carries a unique strand of the infection, we have given them "
#~ "alphabetical designations after the source species in which the strand "
#~ "can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the "
#~ "only thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together "
#~ "physically. We can only assume that new strands of the infection were "
#~ "engineered to suit each species.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When "
#~ "injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have "
#~ "observed the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. "
#~ "Unexpectedly, however, any trace of the infection was subsequently "
#~ "annihilated by standard human T cells. The organism was unable to "
#~ "deactivate our immune system in order to take root.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our "
#~ "soldiers on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep "
#~ "you updated about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our "
#~ "personnel is in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine "
#~ "procedures will be maintained throughout the lab.\n"

#~ "to Earth, burning tanks full of antiprotons. Human experiments into "

#~ "The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms "

#~ "situated near Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland. Not "
#~ "long after, another lab produced approximately 100 atoms. We've come "
#~ "slowly forward over the years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can "
#~ "now produce antiprotons by the millions, it's easy to forget just how "
#~ "little that really is.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the "
#~ "availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even "
#~ "with every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many "
#~ "antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 "
#~ "gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in any "

#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "

#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"

#~ "managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most "
#~ "advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine "
#~ "size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the "
#~ "magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce "
#~ "overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm "
#~ "caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive "
#~ "armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does "
#~ "not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for "
#~ "long-range firefights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other "
#~ "rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. "
#~ "Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to "
#~ "break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at "
#~ "once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the "
#~ "design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. "
#~ "This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"

#~ "than any pistol or SMG.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is "
#~ "the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for "
#~ "us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle "
#~ "remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in "
#~ "tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at "
#~ "these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any "
#~ "sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while "
#~ "rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second "
#~ "assault wave to support the others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, "
#~ "they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively "

#~ "Commander, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
#~ "succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
#~ "achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
#~ "battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies "
#~ "to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. "
#~ "Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part "
#~ "of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they "
#~ "have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers "
#~ "with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an "
#~ "infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications "
#~ "were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-"
#~ "missile batteries.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
#~ "miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
#~ "deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products "
#~ "without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of "
#~ "the inner workings.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen "
#~ "trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are "
#~ "then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The "
#~ "deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of "
#~ "deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's "
#~ "optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses "
#~ "then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even "
#~ "corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium "
#~ "waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering "
#~ "system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling "
#~ "the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed "
#~ "the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is "
#~ "somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will "
#~ "immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
#~ "beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
#~ "production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
#~ "required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be "
#~ "applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted "
#~ "several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn "
#~ "up.\n"

#~ "Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

#~ "Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma "
#~ "weapon family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The "
#~ "blaster requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in "
#~ "and out of secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop "
#~ "with great strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it "
#~ "were a vehicle-mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. "
#~ "The magazines weigh nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated "
#~ "is hot enough to melt through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's "
#~ "increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher "
#~ "bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach "
#~ "distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but "
#~ "the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma "
#~ "chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per "
#~ "minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased "
#~ "thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly "
#~ "even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at "
#~ "all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that "
#~ "any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an "
#~ "extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine "
#~ "gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use "
#~ "is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like "
#~ "most humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one "
#~ "and require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/"
#~ "or the development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the "
#~ "blaster's inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which "
#~ "is documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able "
#~ "to train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, "

#~ "Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've "
#~ "prepared a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of "
#~ "sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing "
#~ "powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out "
#~ "hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can "
#~ "easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the "
#~ "barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a "
#~ "minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which "
#~ "lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds "
#~ "out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory "
#~ "from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't "
#~ "exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when "
#~ "firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough "
#~ "to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical "
#~ "obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to "
#~ "make the weapon much less effective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful "
#~ "electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic "
#~ "coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be "
#~ "too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have "
#~ "made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien "
#~ "engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM "
#~ "weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have "
#~ "anything concrete.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have "
#~ "incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and "
#~ "rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. "
#~ "Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight "
#~ "automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell "
#~ "the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this "
#~ "thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-"
#~ "sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own "
#~ "scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained "
#~ "package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our "
#~ "rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the "
#~ "needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious "
#~ "casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a "
#~ "needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover "
#~ "and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an "
#~ "entrenched needler gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend "
#~ "anyone to try it, Commander.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their "
#~ "technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of "
#~ "Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed "
#~ "critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost "
#~ "three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without "
#~ "inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, "
#~ "and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on "
#~ "Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational "
#~ "record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've "
#~ "managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded "
#~ "that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, "
#~ "especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place "
#~ "at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've "
#~ "chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat "
#~ "package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; "
#~ "the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed "
#~ "for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-"
#~ "breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt "
#~ "the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of "
#~ "shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can "
#~ "protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, "
#~ "the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a "
#~ "tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to "
#~ "fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow "
#~ "the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm "
#~ "centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- "
#~ "solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition "
#~ "has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently "
#~ "against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after "
#~ "penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small "
#~ "projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and "
#~ "other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with "
#~ "these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among "
#~ "the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range "
#~ "than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, "
#~ "providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power "
#~ "as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be "
#~ "effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled "
#~ "slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to "
#~ "wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't "
#~ "expect it to be very effective.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy "
#~ "has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. "
#~ "However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The "
#~ "CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided "
#~ "to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice "
#~ "of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX "
#~ "dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even "
#~ "got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two "
#~ "surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in "
#~ "government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig "
#~ "out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I "
#~ "can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm "
#~ "doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up "
#~ "to the task.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to "
#~ "persuade our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think "
#~ "you'll like it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best "
#~ "aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a "
#~ "cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop "
#~ "transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular "
#~ "alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due "
#~ "to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird "
#~ "with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer "
#~ "moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability "
#~ "across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the "
#~ "lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, "
#~ "however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for "
#~ "civilian applications.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach "
#~ "1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes "
#~ "a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of "
#~ "emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, "
#~ "which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile "
#~ "racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight "
#~ "characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses "
#~ "for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small "
#~ "battlefield vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as "
#~ "the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than "
#~ "any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to "
#~ "threats all over the world.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and "
#~ "deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "전술적 운용방법\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to "
#~ "respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for "
#~ "recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity "
#~ "and to recover downed alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers "
#~ "will immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining "
#~ "troops will secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over "
#~ "and ensure delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. "
#~ "This is important because attempted looting of items left on the "
#~ "battlefield may become a problem in densely-populated regions. We can't "
#~ "afford to lose valuable alien technology because some idiot feels the "
#~ "need to take a souvenir.\n"

#~ "The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the "
#~ "'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking "
#~ "caricature of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents "
#~ "in the field, but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way "
#~ "genetically related to humanity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a "
#~ "professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the "
#~ "product of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and "
#~ "toxicology work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The "
#~ "subject seems to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic "
#~ "tampering and anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible "
#~ "density of the muscle tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than "
#~ "any biological entity on Earth.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be "
#~ "without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive "
#~ "organs, but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins "
#~ "there is a very well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind "
#~ "of electrically conductive gel, that seems to power and control the "
#~ "muscles by direct electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is "
#~ "generated through digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of "
#~ "large eel-like organs underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is "
#~ "nourished by the leftover products of the digestion process by way of "
#~ "veins filled with pressurised air. The whole chest cavity has been richly "
#~ "furnished with armour plating inserted just underneath the leathery green "
#~ "skin.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the "
#~ "Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared "
#~ "spectrum. The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either "
#~ "side of the head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given "
#~ "the evidence we must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the "
#~ "nose and olfactory organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point "
#~ "of being vestigial.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude "
#~ "the following:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than "
#~ "that of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot "
#~ "soldier. Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the "
#~ "battlefield.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of "
#~ "equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to "
#~ "match their size.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances "
#~ "their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. "
#~ "Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, "
#~ "explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the "
#~ "extensive armouring.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with "
#~ "reproductive organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we "
#~ "believe they may have been neutered for some reason.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy "
#~ "infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their "
#~ "somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay "
#~ "down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks "
#~ "do not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used "
#~ "as technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy "
#~ "themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in "
#~ "combat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will "
#~ "require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more "
#~ "detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't "
#~ "seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and "

#~ "\n"

#~ "plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This "
#~ "particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the "
#~ "plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream "
#~ "of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore "
#~ "carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens "
#~ "use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it "
#~ "on the ground in the worst way.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the "
#~ "aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger. "
#~ "Though smaller and lighter than the Plasma Blaster, the PB cannon's "
#~ "recoil is out of this world. It can blast a full grown man clean off his "
#~ "feet in one shot. No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can "
#~ "adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our "
#~ "soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting "
#~ "hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous "
#~ "steel and blow the target back by several metres. This is usually all "
#~ "that's necessary. A second hit will turn the buckle into a fist-sized "
#~ "hole, clean through. Our infantry armour will perform only slightly "
#~ "better, but deflection will help somewhat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The cannon's mechanics are quite simple, nothing that we can't duplicate "
#~ "easily with enough money and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure "
#~ "out is the ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the "
#~ "magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to "
#~ "disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry "
#~ "doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will "

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is painfully clear that soldiers during wartime lead highly stressful "
#~ "lives. In order to maintain morale they need a place to unwind and "
#~ "interact in a rank-free environment. We have sought to provide this kind "
#~ "of R&R in the form of the Team Room facility.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is equipped with a variety of entertainments, from sports tables to "
#~ "high-tech game consoles. It also features a modest wall-mounted cinema "
#~ "display for communal movie screenings. There are vending machines with "
#~ "alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and a separate sitting room for "
#~ "our soldiers to achieve some amount of privacy from the closeness of base "
#~ "living. To this end the sitting room can be locked from the inside for up "
#~ "to 30 minutes per day by each team member. The lock may be overridden "
#~ "from the Control Centre or by a present Command Centre or medical officer "
#~ "in case of an emergency.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "All our equipment requires maintenance, and I would argue that our "
#~ "soldiers require the most maintenance of all. The Team Room is one of the "
#~ "best ways to keep them mentally healthy and in fighting trim.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unless it has access to an operational Power Plant, the Team Room will be "
#~ "shut down to avoid non-vital power consumption.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Team Room is an important tool in maintaining good morale amongst our "
#~ "soldiers and should be built in any base that houses a combat team. It "
#~ "provides them with various vital means of stress relief, which will ease "
#~ "the stressful effects of continued combat, life-threatening situations, "
#~ "and the near-certain death of team members in the field. High morale is "
#~ "essential for our battlefield performance and must be maintained at all "
#~ "costs.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "However, I must stress that the Team Room is not a replacement for base "
#~ "leave. Our soldiers will still need to be allowed off-base from time to "
#~ "time in order to maintain their connection with the outside world and "
#~ "their sanity.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "For the purposes of a base attack, the Team Room is an extremely low-risk "
#~ "installation with little to no strategic value. If encountered by "
#~ "extraterrestrial attackers, it will almost certainly be bypassed "
#~ "altogether in favour of more sensitive installations.\n"

#~ "사령관님, I'm extremely pleased to report that our project has been "
#~ "succesful. I've included images of our prototype laser weapon, which "
#~ "achieves continuous wave output in a man-portable package.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger "
#~ "battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies "
#~ "to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. "
#~ "Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part "
#~ "of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they "
#~ "have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers "
#~ "with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an "
#~ "infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications "
#~ "were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-"
#~ "missile batteries.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in "
#~ "miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the "
#~ "deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products "
#~ "without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of "
#~ "the inner workings.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen "
#~ "trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are "
#~ "then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The "
#~ "deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of "
#~ "deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's "
#~ "optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses "
#~ "then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even "
#~ "corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium "
#~ "waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering "
#~ "system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling "
#~ "the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed "
#~ "the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is "
#~ "somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will "
#~ "immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible "
#~ "beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale "
#~ "production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is "
#~ "required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be "
#~ "applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted "
#~ "several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn "
#~ "up.\n"

#~ "Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests "

#~ "police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will "
#~ "perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for "

#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"

#~ "need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to "
#~ "shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the "
#~ "equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the "
#~ "reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information "
#~ "will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of "
#~ "infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This "
