"Commander,\n"
"\n"
"My team has finished conducting a number of tests on our captives that have shed some light on the aliens' behaviour.\n"
"\n"
"In one experiment, an alien specimen was given a box of food, sealed by a two-digit number lock. The subject took six hours to find the right combination by trial and error. This places the alien's IQ well below most large terrestrial mammals; however, when other subjects in the Containment were given the same task, with exactly the same lock, they all immediately input the right combination on their first attempt without having been exposed to the first specimen's attempts. We know how this looks, Commander, but I assure you my team and I have been thoroughly conscientious about security and separation. The aliens have not been allowed to communicate in any way. We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about these events, though we're working on it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at best. Various ways of communication have been attempted without success. Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do not seem to speak or sign in any sense that we understand. Pheromone communication has had no effect beyond simple physical reactions. The large biological disparity between alien species also creates its own share of problems with containment and communication -- please refer to the alien autopsy reports for more details on individual alien physiology.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently working on teaching an isolated group how to express desire, acknowledgement and denial. Their intelligence is too limited to attempt anything more sophisticated at the moment. Once the subjects have mastered these basic concepts, we will have some data on the rate at which the aliens can learn, and a solid foundation upon which to build. Yamamura hopes we can gradually raise their communication skills until they can make themselves intelligible to us, thereby spreading this knowledge to others of their kind who may possess superior intellect and talents.\n"
"\n"
"As always, I will keep you informed, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"The practical solution did not lie in futilely trying to create bigger battery packs, but rather in using radical miniaturisation technologies to lighten and scale down existing chemical-powered laser components. Chemical lasers have been in use for a very long time, and have been part of experimental weapons programs since the late 20th century, but they have always suffered many problems. The only types of chemical lasers with real military promise have been much too large and cumbersome for an infantryman to carry into battle. Until now their combat applications were limited to those of tank-mounted laser cannons or ship-based anti-missile batteries.\n"
"\n"
"Now, however, we at PHALANX have built a conventional laser cannon in miniature. Despite its small size it is fully capable of handling the deuterium-fluoride reaction and containing the toxic waste products without danger of contamination. Let me give you a brief description of the inner workings.\n"
"\n"
"Inside the combustion chamber, ethylene is burned in nitrogen trifluoride. This reaction produces excited fluorine radicals, which are then brought into contact with a mixture of helium and deuterium gas. The deuterium reacts with the fluorine, producing excited molecules of deuterium fluoride. These undergo stimulated emission in the weapon's optical resonator, generating the beam. A series of intelligent lenses then focuses and directs the beam to the shooter's aiming point and even corrects for minor movement by the shooter or the target. The deuterium waste gas is rammed through our custom-designed high-pressure filtering system, which catches all toxic or radioactive molecules before expelling the remaining harmless vapour back into the atmosphere.\n"
"\n"
"The filter needs to be replaced after every mission, but we've designed the system to make this easy and painless. If the filter system is somehow damaged during the course of an operation, the weapon will immediately stop functioning in order to prevent contamination.\n"
"\n"
"The laser operates on mid-infrared wavelengths, so it produces no visible beam except to those wearing IR goggles.\n"
"\n"
"The prototype we built is unfortunately not yet ready for full-scale production as an infantry weapon, since more refining and balancing is required for human use, but the innovations we've made can also be applied to vehicle weapons -- perhaps even aircraft guns. I've submitted several new proposals to your inbox for the principal ideas we've drawn up.\n"
"\n"
"Let me know when you want us to start working on them, Commander.\n"

"指挥官，我非常高兴地向您报告，我们的项目成功了。附上我们激光武器原型的图片，那是在一个便携包中实现连续波输出。\n"

"实际方案并不在于无谓的尝试更大的电池组,而是用彻底的小型化技术去减轻和缩小化学能激光组件。化学激光器已经应用了非常长的时间，20实际晚期他就成为实验性武器计划的一部分，但是它总是遇到一些问题。作为符合真实军事承诺的化学激光器的唯一类型，对一个步兵来说将它带到战场上过于庞大和笨重。直到现在它们的作战应用仅限于那些坦克激光炮或者海基反导弹电池。\n"
"\n"
"然而，现在我们在PHALANX建造了一台小型常规激光炮。尽管它尺寸小，它却完全具有处理氟化氘反应和容纳有毒废料制品的能力，而没有污染的危险。请允许我向各位简要介绍一下内部工作原理。\n"
"\n"
"在燃烧室内，乙烯在三氟化氮中燃烧。这种反应产生活跃的氟自由基，然后带入并与氦和氘的气体混合物接触。氘与氟反应，产生活跃的氟化氘分子。这些在武器的光学物理共振器中经过激发，产生光束。一系列智能镜头对射手的瞄准点进行聚焦和控制光束，甚至能对射手或目标的微小振动做出修正。通过我们定制的高压过滤系统，氘的废料被冲压，有毒的或者放射性分子在剩余无害蒸汽排放到大气前被全部捕获。\n"
"\n"
"每次任务后过滤器需更换，不过我们已经设计了能轻松容易的做这项工作的系统。如果过滤系统在运转期间莫名其妙的受损，为了防止造成污染，武器将立即停止运作。\n"
"\n"
"激光器工作在中红外波段，因此他产生不可见光束，除非带上红外护目镜。\n"
"\n"
"不幸的是，对于人们更精确和平衡的使用要求，我们建造的原型机尚未准备作为步兵武器而全面生产，但是通过创新，我们也已经能将它应用到车辆武器上——甚至是航空炮。我已经提交了几个关于我们制定的主要思路的新建议到您的收件箱。\n"

"\n"
"Many countries and companies have attempted to create weapons-grade lasers over the years, but no one has ever been able to create a laser that's man-portable and has a power output high enough to compete with ordinary firearms.

"What we've done is we've stripped down our pre-existing SAM turret design and modified it to fit an upscaled deuterium-fluoride reaction chamber. We've beefed up the electrical systems to help amplify beam output, adding several megawatts to power and several dozen kilometres to effective range. The turret servos have been completely replaced with a computer-controlled mag-lev system to improve accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The result is that our new Base Defence Laser Turret is capable of tracking targets at any conceivable speed within Earth's atmosphere. It can lock on to targets almost instantly, and is powerful enough even at long range to damage UFO armour after only a few seconds of fire. Accuracy is good; the laser suffers much less from alien EW (Electronic Warfare) activity than missiles and can even predict basic evasive manoeuvres.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, as with any laser, range remains a problem. Atmospheric blooming limits effective range to only a few hundred kilometres. Weather effects and cloud cover can provide even more serious challenges and, in some conditions, could slash effective range by more than 50%. Lastly, the laser can only fire continuously for about 120 seconds before overheating comes into play, and it requires up to 60 seconds to cool down and recharge capacitors before it's ready to fire again.\n"
"\n"
"Despite these limitations, the Base Defence Laser Turret should provide an effective deterrent for most UFOs straying near our bases, and can provide assistance in shooting down alien craft at short range. It's going to be a good facility to have when one of our bases is in a pinch.\n"

"The subject is certainly alive, and we have put it through an extensive array of toxicology experiments which have provided vital data about its vulnerabilities to various chemicals and bio-agents. However, we have been completely unable to produce a behavioural analysis of the alien mind. This is because the specimen has showed virtually no signs of intelligence since its capture. It has done little more than eat, sleep, and stare at the walls of its containment unit. It responds to physical stimuli with reflex actions, aggression and/or submission, but we could not coax any information out of it.

"I have made a thorough examination of the devices found during the alien autopsies we've performed. I believe we're now ready to present our conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"From our investigation of tissue growth and scarring around the alien larynx, we conclude that these artifacts are surgically implanted in an alien's throat at a very early age. Somewhere during adolescence, the child-sized device is removed and an adult version is implanted.\n"
"\n"
"We've examined several different possibilities for the device's function, from food preprocessors to suicide equipment, but the obvious answer turned out to be the correct one. It is some kind of respirator, allowing the aliens to survive in our atmosphere, and possibly other atmospheres as well. Every organic specimen we've autopsied has carried one of these devices, all with the same basic functionality, implying that their constant operation is either required for survival on the alien homeworld or that we are seeing only specimens which are intended for frequent planetary operations. Certainly external breathing apparatus would be easier and more economical to use if these specimens were only intended to take short trips into hostile atmospheres.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself consists of a sophisticated filter stretched across the subject's windpipe, and two small spherical tanks positioned on either side of the brainstem, connected to the windpipe by a small metal tube. These tanks are filled with a gas mixture compressed into a liquid state, functioning much like a scuba diver's oxygen bottles. The filter mechanism is semi-intelligent; it scrupulously removes all elements that are harmful to the subject, but allows beneficial elements to pass through. The tanks are refilled by way of a small mechanical navel at the back of the alien's neck.\n"
"\n"
"An examination of the tanks' contents has given us our first accurate data on the alien atmosphere. We now have several mixtures on record that we believe will be able to support various alien lifeforms in our Containment unit. A few of the mixtures are nitrogen-oxygen compounds, very similar to our own, but others don't contain any oxygen at all. If all of these mixtures are actively used by one or more alien species, some of our enemies seem to breathe an atmosphere of almost pure methane.\n"
"\n"
"The vastly different mixtures are actually giving us a bit of a puzzle. Surely it would be more economical to use segregated crews than to force these species to coexist in the same place?\n"
"\n"
"Future questions aside, I'm well pleased with our present results. We can now store aliens in our Containment unit for prolonged periods of time -- they will no longer suffocate when their atmosphere tanks run out. This usually happens after 24 hours without replenishment, so no delays should be afforded when we manage to capture a specimen.\n"

"\n"
"我们对这个装置的功能作了多方面调查，包括食物预处理或自杀等等，但最后都证明早期猜测的答案是正确的。这是某种形式的呼吸器，可以让异形能在我们的生存环境或其他可能的大气环境下生存。每一个异形我们解剖都发现有这种装置，都是一样的作用，这意味着他们频繁的从事外空活动，而不是只在他们的星球活动。如果这些异形只是来我们这里敌对的外空环境作短暂旅行的话，外部呼吸器会更容易使用而且也更经济。\n"
"\n"
"该装置本身是一个复杂的过滤器，覆盖整个主气道，同时在两边的脑干有两个小型球罐也通过一个小金属管与之相连。这些球罐里充满了由混合气体压缩成的液体，作用就像潜水员的氧气瓶。这个过滤器是半智能的，它可以严格过滤有害物质，只保留无害的元素通过。球罐再充方式是靠脖子后面的一个小机械脐带完成的。\n"
"\n"
"球罐里的气体让我们第一次了解异形所在星球的环境。我们现在收集了一些具体的数据，应该可以用在异性收容所的大气室设置上。里面有少数氮氧化合物，和我们自己的非常相似，但没有任何氧气的成分。如果所有这些混合物确实是某种或多种异形需要的，那似乎其中有些异形的生活环境充满了大量纯甲烷。\n"

We're not yet willing to commit to any definite hypothesis about these events, though we're working on it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, results of our other experiments have been inconclusive at best. Various ways of communication have been attempted without success. Despite having fully functional vocal cords and/or working hands, they do not seem to speak or sign in any sense that we understand. Pheromone communication has had no effect beyond simple physical reactions. The large biological disparity between alien species also creates its own share of problems with containment and communication -- please refer to the alien autopsy reports for more details on individual alien physiology.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, I believe we're making progress, however slowly. Communication with the aliens is certainly within the realm of possibility. Our studies confirm that all alien specimens react to external stimuli. This means that we can make them respond, one way or another. Dr. Yamamura is currently working on teaching an isolated group how to express desire, acknowledgement and denial. Their intelligence is too limited to attempt anything more sophisticated at the moment. Once the subjects have mastered these basic concepts, we will have some data on the rate at which the aliens can learn, and a solid foundation upon which to build. Yamamura hopes we can gradually raise their communication skills until they can make themselves intelligible to us, thereby spreading this knowledge to others of their kind who may possess superior intellect and talents.\n"

"在一项实验中，给一个异形标本一箱食物，箱子上有两个数字锁。这个家伙花了6小时不断试验找到了正确答案。看来这个异形的智力大大低于地球上的高等哺乳动物，但是，在收容所其他房间作同样的测试，完全一样的锁，那些异形根本没做任何尝试一下就打开了。长官，我知道这看起来好像那里出了点问题，但我向你保证，我的小组是彻底把它们分开隔离了。在没有允许的情况下异形没有任何互相沟通机会。尽管我们十分努力，但还是无法对此做出合理的假设。\n"

"不幸的是，我们其他的实验也没有确定的结果。各种方式的沟通都没有成功。尽管它们有功能齐全的声带和灵巧操作武器的双手，但它们似乎没有任何有智力的话语或文字。大多数的沟通一直都是简单的条件反应。收容所里各种不同物种的异形都是如此--关于个别物种的生理特性请参阅异形解剖报告。\n"
"\n"
"尽管如此，我认为我们还是取得了部分进展，只是进展十分缓慢。异形肯定有某种沟通方式。我们的研究确认，所有异形对外部刺激都有反应。这意味着，我们可以使他们以某种方式作出回应。山村博士目前正在带领一个教学组在教它们如何表达点头和摇头。它们的智力太低，无法应付更复杂的事情。不过先有了基本概念，才好让它们学到更多的，我们也能收集一些新的数据资料。山村希望我们能够逐步提高他们的沟通技巧，直到他们达到和我们沟通的智力水平，让它们之间互相传递这种沟通技巧或许能找到真正有智力的家伙。\n"

"We have spent the past few weeks investigating these strange occurrences in our Containment unit, and we believe we've formulated a theory that may begin to explain the aliens' newfound intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"It seems that we were off in our preliminary appraisal of how the alien intellect works. We first believed them to be autonomously operating individuals, in the same way humans are, though with superior communications and team tactics. However, our lab experiments and an intense review of battlefield footage now seem to contradict that hypothesis.\n"
"\n"
"In our video records, we have often seen the aliens seeking cover, coordinating their fire, working as a team even though they carry no obvious communications equipment. However, when we captured a few live specimens in our Containment unit, they never displayed anything above the level of animal instinct. This seems incongruous with the evidence we have; large, well-developed brain structures and a proven knowledge of combat tactics.\n"
"\n"
"We sought to reconcile these ideas in a new hypothesis, and our experiments have begun to produce tangible results. The new specimens certainly are responsible for the strange behaviour we've observed, but we originally assumed that they were officers of some type under colour of authority. We now believe that theory to also be wrong. Our experiments prove that when the aliens are allowed to congregate, with or without the suspected 'officers', they become significantly more active and sophisticated. When they are separated from each other for a large enough distance, they revert back to their basic states. The conclusion is obvious. There is some kind of communal force binding these creatures together.\n"
"\n"
"A string of new theories has emerged. The most likely explanation is in the alien brain. There are several species of alien, all of which meet the physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more intelligent as it grows in numbers. We're not sure how it's possible for this hive mind to cross species boundaries; it's obvious that the different alien races originated on different worlds, with vastly divergent evolutionary paths, and some species appear to have been around far longer than others. However, given the aliens' advanced technology, the 'how' is less of an enigma than the 'why'.\n"
"\n"
"These new findings also seem to suggest that specimens down on Earth are cut off from the source of their intelligence. While this may be an important advantage for PHALANX forces, it also brings up threats we had not yet considered. Our research into alien physiology has established that isolated specimens cannot survive very long in our environment, and behave with little enough intelligence while they're on the surface; but if a large enough number is allowed to escape and coordinate with each other -- or with alien sympathisers on Earth -- we could be looking at a serious infiltration risk.\n"
"\n"
"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\n"

"在过去的几个星期内我们已经调查了这些发生在收容所的奇怪现象，我们相信我们已经得到了一个理论，可能可以解释异形的新智力。\n"
"\n"
"看来，我们要推翻先前对异形智力的初步评价了。我们一开始认为它们是各自为主完成上级命令战术的，就和人类一样。然而，我们的实验结果和战场记录现在好像产生了矛盾。\n"
"\n"
"在我们的视频记录里，我们常常看到异形寻求掩护，协调火力，即使它们没有明显的通讯设备但配合得也很好。然而，当我们抓获了几个异形关押在我们的收容所以后，它们从来没有什么比动物更高的智力行为。这和发达的大脑结构以及战场上的战术表现完全不同。\n"
"\n"
"我们产生了一个新的假设，对此作的实验有很好的实际结果。我们已经看到新的异形犯人肯定是奇怪现象产生的某种原因，原先以为他们是某种高级军官来指挥其它异形导致了这个的发生。现在可以肯定事实不是这样。我们的实验证明，当把异形聚集在一起的时候，不管有没有“军官”，它们都变得更加活跃。当把他们分隔的足够远以后，它们就又回复到原先的状态。结论是显而易见的，有某种形式的团队力量造成了这个。\n"
"\n"
"新的理论出现了，可以解释这是怎么回事。这几个异形物种，所有的生理条件都说明他们是有智商的，但他们很少有自己的脑电波活动。这就意味着在他们之间存在某种分布式心灵感应，数量越多，这种感应就越来越聪明。我们不能确定它是如何作用到不同物种的，很明显的是这些异形物种来自不同的世界，有大大不同的进化道路，有些物种的数量还明显多于其他人。但是对于外星高科技来说，问“如何”不如问“为什么”。\n"
"\n"
"新的发现似乎表明，异形来到地球切断了和他们世界的感应联系。虽然这可能对我们的作战小队来说是一个好消息，但它也带来了我们没有考虑到的麻烦。我们的生理研究已经确定，孤立的异形无法在我们的环境里生存很长时间，也无法为我们提供足够的情报，但如果数量太多又会彼此协商逃跑--这确实是个麻烦。\n"

"现在在我们手里的几个异形，他们的智力似乎已经接近人类的水平。如果我们能够创造一个合适的翻译装置或沟通语言，我相信我们有可能最终可以和基地关押的异形进行交流。或许先由我们的语言学家或心理学专家来建立一个对话。这是一个不容忽视的调查渠道。\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"我很高兴向大家报告，通过不断努力，我们在收容所关押的异形身上取得了相当好的成果。山村博士的做法逐渐开始见效。异形学会了用二进制和人类的手语来传达信息，他们似乎能理解大多数的问题和指示。山村和他的助手仍在工作，尽量完善我们使用的手语，而其余的研究人员都在集中试图从心灵感应方面取得突破。这很不容易。异形一直沉默不语，我们需要使用大量的化学刺激才能使他们有心灵交流。这种伤亡率一直很高。\n"
"\n"
"但是，我们有重大的发现。举例来说，心灵感应似乎无法识别身份。它对例如“我”或“我们”，“你”和“他们”毫无概念。它只能理解数字方面的词，比如一个或多个，一个人或一个团体。这表明人类的思想和异形的思想严重脱节。这种思维意识不会把个人当作独立封闭的实体。正因如此，在分析会上，我们拼凑出来一种合理的答案。我们相信，所有的异形共享一个单一的思维。长官，我的意思是所有异形。这不只是一种提高团队效率或鼓励团队精神的手段，这是异形社会不可缺少的组成部分。在强大的心灵感应里，每一个异形的生命和呼吸都是平等和相同的，甚至不同物种的异形也是。其间的差异只有生存的物质需求不同而已。\n"
"\n"
"此外，这心灵感应该使我们很难和个别异形沟通交流，更不用说通过某种原始的手语。以人理解来说就像试图和某人的脚趾进行交谈，或者说和自己身体里的一个单细胞在谈话。当然，这提出了一个问题：异形的耳朵和大脑真的在用吗。\n"
"\n"
"无疑，在收容所的异形不在我们假设的在外星世界存在的大心灵感应范围之内。他们在执行地球任务的时候似乎切断了这种联系，在返回以后才会再次加入。这是否是因为距离或其他某种太空因素造成的，我们无从可知。关于这个问题异形的解答也是很模糊的。\n"
"\n"
"长官，这就是我的报告。最后，我想请求您许可，我们继续研究如何更有效地说服这些俘虏的方法。我必须强调，我们需要新的健康的异形样本来取代损失的。在收容所我们必须让他们只有孤立的心灵感应。如果不能做到这点将是一个重大的挫折。\n"

Over the past few weeks, DivIntel has been making a push into the areas in which the infection is most concentrated, in order to try and find some piece of intel that could help us understand how and why this infection spreads so fast from these focal points. I have been personally supervising the effort.\n"
"\n"
"It paid off this morning.\n"
"\n"
"Our reconnaisance teams have located what appears to be a camouflaged alien installation. The size and purpose of this installation is unknown, but we've established that it is located at the exact heart of an infection hot-spot. I harbour grave suspicions that this facility is directly connected with the lightning spread of XVI in the region. At this point it also seems likely there are more of these planetside installations, built right under our noses, serving as command centres and bases of operation for the alien threat.\n"
"\n"
"Dealing with these bases has to be one of our top priorities. I recommend we send a heavily-armed team to pay them a visit, a bit of reconnaissance-in-force. We need more information about the layout and purpose of the base, and the best way to do that is to capture it. We should eliminate all aliens at the location and, once we've secured the area and salvaged what we need, destroy the entire installation. This should constitute a significant blow to alien operations and restrict -- if not halt -- the spread of XVI in the area.\n"
"\n"
"Of course this mission will be highly dangerous. The base is right in the middle of an infection hot-spot, so the entire area is hostile territory. We may encounter anti-air ordnance and UFOs scrambled to the base's defence. A heavy escort will certainly be required. And . . . there's worse.\n"

We're having a great deal of trouble applying our standard interrogation methods. The truth serum we have available has several distinct limitations; it tends to produce a lethal allergic reaction in most alien bodies unless we restrict it to smaller, insufficient doses, which worsens the serum's already incomplete effect on alien physiology. We've encountered numerous small lies and half-truths in the sessions we've taken so far. Torture has been attempted to influence this behaviour, but to no avail. Pain seems to have no corrective effect on the hive mind.\n"

"更大的障碍是注射会使心理自我保护， 对其产生抵抗。 如果一个异形产生了抵抗， 由于心灵感应其余的标本也会产生抵抗， 那我们就要重新开始。\n"

"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' -- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"在异形起源这个项目我们取得了一定的成果，我相信这对您会有帮助。这是我的总结报告。\n"
"\n"
"该项目得到了各方各面的全力协助。在很短时间内，我们就直接控制了太阳系中的每一个民用或军用侦测系统，包括一些在小行星带的秘密设施（经由联合国保证严守秘密的情况下取到的）。我们的深空探测扫描了每一寸有迹象显示可能存在外星基地的地方。利用这些资源我们在过去两个星期已经连续检查了太阳系里大约90％的可疑地点。余下的10％也在过去40分钟内检查了。\n"
"\n"
"不幸的是，我们没有找到有外星舰队藏匿在太阳系的任何证据。我们一直在做的很彻底，这个结果是确实的。没有什么方法可以绝对肯定我们的结论是正确的，但我声明以下结论是可靠的：\n"
"\n"
"我们认为在太阳系没有外星舰队或基地。\n"
"\n"
"这就是问题的答案，但对我们更进一步了解外星人来自何处却没有任何帮助。事实上，问题是他们如何到这里的。异形在我们的太阳系没有根据地，如何才能让UFO到地球？\n"
"\n"
"我和纳瓦尔长官以及他的团队讨论了很久，试图找出真正的事实，而不是疯子般的胡乱猜测。幸好，命运给了我们需要的东西。\n"
"\n"
"幸运的是，我们拿到了MIMIR太空望远镜上周的视频记录，'如何'这个问题终于有了发现。经观看录像，我们发现MIMIR太空望远镜意外的捕捉到了UFO抵达瞬间。我们有全部的可见光和红外线记录，一架陌生型号的UFO'突然'出现在离地球大约10000公里的地方，在那里点燃了发动机飞向地球。\n"
"\n"
"这当然也可能是异形有一些独特方式的'隐形'技术，我们无法检测到UFO，但我们有强烈怀疑这一点，UFO出现是非常突然的，同时还伴随有大量伽玛射线爆发以及瞬间重力异常。没有丝毫证据证明在UFO出现之前那个位置就有东西存在。\n"
"\n"
"而最有可能的是，也是最可怕的：异形没有必要在我们太阳系设立据点，因为他们可以超光速移动。显然这个超光速装置使他们能够从一个我们不知道的地方直接'跳'到太阳系。我们不知道如何做到这一点的，在我们认知的物理理论里，这是不可能的，不管是广义相对论还是因果关系或特殊相对论都无法做到这一点。异形可能很清楚知道我们做不到这一点。\n"
"\n"
"我们的下一个优先事项应该是捕获有超光速装备的UFO，以便我们可以学习和掌握这种装置。显然，这将不会是一件容易的事，但掌握这个用来反击是非常重要的--特别是我们要结束这场艰苦的战争。\n"
"\n"
"当然，最后决定如何平衡短期的防备需要和长远的计划在于你，指挥官。\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"虽然作战很艰苦，但我们当务之急首先应该找出来这些异形到底来自哪里。现实是，它们从外空进入地球，在我们的监测屏幕上随心所欲的飞来飞去，不知道什么时候又突然消失。我们必须找出这到底发生了什么。它们来自何方，它们如何来到这里，它们要做什么，它们要去哪里？\n"
"\n"
"现在还没有任何证据显示在地球轨道上或太阳系中有它们的舰队或基地，但这并不意味着它们不存在。小行星带以及火星和海王星之间，我们基本无法探测，再加上UFO的超强隐形能力，异形很可能已经在地球表面某处建立据点。不完全扫描整个太阳系几乎不可能找到它们。\n"
"\n"
"因此我设计了一个新的计划，这个计划旨在通过追踪异形活动来找出它们的根据地。运用超大光学望远镜和射电望远镜，我们监测太阳系里的所有可疑活动，同时我们的研究员将全力分析每次入侵的活动信息，力图找出某种规律或轨道。即使只有一支舰队躲在火星或其他外太空，它们派出的UFO或回去的UFO终究会揭露出它们所在的位置。只要给我足够的“眼睛”，我想发现它们不会需要太多时间。\n"

msgid "Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal -- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I can.\n"

"长官，我和我的小组已经完成了对UFO的分析。这真是奇迹般的工程制品，我们都盼望着有机会能掌握所有这一切的技术。\n"
"\n"
"奇特的飞船设计对我们来说有多问题需要探索。大部分的设计从表面上看似乎没有意义。我们成功对它作了各种分析--在实验室条件下对外星飞船材料作了详尽测试--我们已经对UFO的能力有了迄今为止较为清晰的了解。下面列出我们最重要的几项发现。\n"
"\n"
"--外星推进系统是一种完全不同于地球产品的火箭发动机。它直接采用物质和反物质湮灭产生的动力，通过往反应室注射质子和反质子来产生能量，然后引导这种爆炸性的力量传到引擎尾部。这使UFO有极高的动力，而且不需要空气或其他任何媒介作反推力，从而可以在真空中也能自由飞行。有一个高度先进的冷却系统不断抽取液氮来冷却发动机的反应室，还能部分减少红外特征。发动机的能量还用于供应飞船的电力需求。\n"
"\n"
"--燃料箱非常非常小，只有几克重量，但即使这样找到的时候还是差一点吓到我。如果其中的一个燃料箱发生反应或泄漏，哪怕只有十分之三克的反物质反应，威力就会超过广岛原子弹。当然，燃料箱的外部结构和其所在机身位置都有一定的防护设备，但它们并不完美。被直接击中的燃料箱仍有可能引起爆炸。大部分的爆炸对UFO的强硬结构都构不成危险，但任何爆炸对我们自己来说是一个极端的危险。唯一可取的是，质子反质子湮灭不存在放射性污染。\n"
"\n"
"--人类的探测设备几乎很难发现UFO。这是由于UFO的外部材料非常有效地吸收各种辐射。最幸运的发现是，被动式红外和伽马辐射检测都还有效，因为发动机产生的能量太大了。\n"
"\n"
"--由于船体材料过于沉重，升降翼采用了和机身不同的超薄材料。飞船高速飞行只需要很小的升降翼。这些材料本身相当惊人，由部分金属和塑料聚合物组成。它的职能作为一个记忆合金，可以'记住'至少有两个指定的形状，在冷的时候，缩小成一个更紧凑的形式，在热的时候自动伸展成一种更合适的飞行状态。它比任何已知的地球上物质（除纯碳纳米管以外）都坚固，而且很轻巧。对它作更多的研究无疑是很有必要的。\n"
"\n"
"有了这些事实，我们现在可以开始分析UFO的不同部件的作用了。我建议，我们的工程师应马上开始拆解零件。谁知道我们又会发现什么更惊人的东西？\n"
"\n"
"对UFO很值得做更多的研究。我认为，我们可以更深入地钻研它的功能，或许能获得一些它如何运作的知识。我会尽快寄给您有关的研究草案。\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"自从战场上开始使用防弹装备，如在第一次世界大战时的头盔和在越战时的防弹背心，手枪的作用越来越有限。由于其发弹初速和其他自动武器相比低了很多，子弹穿透能力也就很弱。对于越来越先进的防弹装甲--特别是外星复合防弹衣，手枪几乎完全失去了作用。在如今的二十一世纪，军事上还继续使用的手枪大都使用了超高速底火。\n"
"\n"
"其中最主要的新一代超级手枪是来自俄罗斯的DV762。它的设计理念和它的国家一样，坚固、耐用、可靠并且廉价。设计上也很简单，所用的材料非常的坚固，完全能够承受新式火药的压力。自从DV762发布以来的20世纪后期就再也没有其他更先进的手枪了。\n"
"\n"
"DV762不是多功能手枪。设计的目的只有一个：打穿装甲和杀死敌人。在我们的测试里，DV762无论是半自动或三连发模式，表现的都极为优异。这种手枪可以轻易的在10米以外打穿一个现代化的头盔。\n"
"\n"
"不幸的是，为了提高穿透能力，DV牺牲了在内部爆炸的能力。7.62毫米子弹往往会在敌人身上留下一个非常清楚干净的洞，而很少有子弹爆炸的伤口，这也产生了一些问题。使用这个武器往往需要直接命中敌人的重要器官或主动脉才能瘫痪或杀死敌人。\n"
"\n"
"根据神剑计划的宗旨，我们的结论是，首先要保证能够击中才能再要求效果。对于外星装甲我们完全不了解。就我们所知的而言DV762是可以用来对付异形的。\n"

"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever we need an automatic weapon no larger than our own P-12, this is the weapon that fills the gap.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine pistol the classification MP-699.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MP-699 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo. It is a good alternative for soldiers who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them can be carried conveniently.\n"
"\n"
"A single MP-699 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"自从战场上开始使用防弹装备，如在第一次世界大战时的头盔和在越战时的防弹背心，手枪的作用越来越有限。由于其发弹初速和其他自动武器相比低了很多，子弹穿透能力也就很弱。对于越来越先进的防弹装甲--特别是外星复合防弹衣，手枪几乎完全失去了作用。在如今的二十一世纪，军事上还继续使用的手枪大都使用了超高速底火。\n"
"\n"
"超高速底火的主要缺点是，它不能用于全自动武器，任何枪管都无法承受连续底火爆炸产生的压力。英国APMP冲锋手枪通过使用更多的普通炸药来解决这个难题，它的枪管很长，子弹可以达到更高的速度和更大的动能。这是一款真正的全自动手枪，能每分钟打出600发子弹。它有三种发射模式：半自动、三发连射和全自动。\n"
"\n"
"APMP冲锋手枪使用专配的4.2x24mm子弹，可以轻易打穿老式防弹背心。子弹一旦进入人体就会爆炸造成巨大的创伤空腔。对于现代防弹衣这种子弹穿甲效果不是很好，但这可以由APMP的多发式攻击能力来弥补。缺点是APMP冲锋枪由于它的尺寸较大，操作起来不是很方便，射击精度不是很好。\n"

"\n"
"灵巧的士兵甚至可能会考虑双手同时使用两把手枪，但这会降低准确性和减少有效射程。\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French Leblanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"\n"
"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in 2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire when and where they need it most.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"The MG12 will be an extremely valuable tool in controlling the battlefield. It can set up mobile strongpoints from which to stage attacks on alien positions, it can provide effective suppressive or diversionary fire from all ranges, or it can be used simply as a powerful medium-range assault weapon.\n"

"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW (Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"

"概况\n"
"\n"
"孟买事件让我们清楚的认识到他们的技术是如此的先进。英联邦军队根本对它们构成不了威胁，他们损失了三个营才只是让异形停止了脚步。PHALANX要获得胜利必须使用人类技术最高的产品。\n"
"\n"
"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"南非的MPMDS（多用途火箭发射系统）非常经典。这是市场上最好的步兵导弹发射器，能够发射反坦克高爆火箭弹。原本设计是打算用于轻型野战炮。这款武器是不久前才设计完成的，唯一的一次实战测试就是在孟买。这是当时英联邦军队为数不多的可以发挥作用的武器。\n"
"\n"
"外星飞船会在空中或地面上发出大量的电子干扰，以至于普通智能导弹完全无效。军事工程师对此也无能为力。相反的是，MPMDS却在战场发挥了作用可以有效地打击了外星入侵者，这是因为它本身没有多少电子导航设备。\n"
"\n"
"它使用的是120毫米火箭弹。火箭弹发射以后，翅片会自动展开，以保持飞行的稳定，最大有效射程为70米。意想不到的是，弹体只有三个组成部分：一个火箭助推器，一个弹头和一个触发引信。这种简单的结构在最恶劣的情况下也能可靠的发挥作用。虽然准确性不是很高，但威力很大，可以摧毁任何东西，甚至是异形。\n"
"\n"
"该发射器的标准弹载包括：高爆火箭弹，穿甲火箭弹和燃烧火箭弹。英联邦的军工厂在战争开始以前刚刚设计完这些新型MPMDS火箭弹。我们获得了所有的数据文件，可以利用这些资料研发新型的火箭弹。\n"
"\n"
"和HPGL榴弹发射器一样，这种武器将提供我们部队需要的火力支援。\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX使用的是HPML型火箭发射器。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"HPML最好用在火力支援，高爆或燃烧火箭弹可以提供火力掩护我们的攻击部队。然而，应当注意不要误伤自己的队友，近距离爆炸会带来灾难性的后果。\n"
"\n"
"发射器使用时后方不要有人，发射过程中的热废气是极其危险的。该款HPML不能用于攻击8米以内的目标。如果强行使用该武器攻击8米以内目标，可能会导致射手和附近其他小组成员阵亡。目标过于接近，应该使用其他武器作防御，而不是用这个来自杀。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"注解\n"
"\n"
"该武器和狙击步枪及榴弹发射器是为数不多的可以有效打击异形的地球武器。"

"This is a 120mm solid-fuel rocket fitted with a High-Explosive warhead. It is fired electronically by a spark igniter inside the launcher's barrel. The fuel is highly stable and resists concussion and heat, though it can cook off if exposed to high temperatures for a significant period of time. The warhead itself is completely inert unless armed by the impact trigger. Fire cannot set it off unless and until it's armed. Like C4 explosive, the unarmed compound inside the warhead will burn rather than explode when exposed to heat or open flame.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

msgid "The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each reload) and a small ammo capacity. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal.\n"

"布劳特步枪采用轨道枪的设计结构。由于效率低下和很难实现我们放弃了采用线圈枪的设计结构。轨道枪的工作原理是利用电磁力沿着两条轨道来推动导体弹头。当电流通过轨道时在其中产生磁场。磁场穿过弹头并与电流形成90°角。这会在两个轨道的边缘上产生排斥力并以高速发射出弹头。\n"
"\n"
"世界上第一个大型轨道炮建于20世纪70年代，有一个巨大的发电工厂来提供其所需要的500兆焦耳能量。发电设备在过去一个世纪左右改进了不少，可体积仍然很庞大，根本无法取代靠化学推进剂作用的枪支。轨道枪另一个主要缺点是轨道极易被侵蚀。每一次发射都会严重损害两侧的轨道，特别是如果接触点损坏过于严重电流将无法经由轨道传导至弹头。连续发射将会降低子弹的发射速度。每次发射都会或多或少减少轨道的有效长度。\n"
"\n"
"幸运的是，我们找到了一种方法来解决这个问题。就是在每次发射以后装载新的轨道。\n"
"\n"
"这个概念是受到弹夹的启发，每支弹夹都会预先加装多枚子弹。现在同样的方法就是弹夹不光装子弹还配备有更换的轨道。每个轨道都是单独的，其自身有能源储备。每次发射都会使用新的轨道，其电力足够一次发射使用。当所有子弹打完以后，士兵只需更换弹夹就可以了。\n"
"\n"
"子弹是专门研发的3.2x40mm大型钨合金子弹。穿甲性能十分出色。在贯穿目标的同时还会分裂产生更大的损害。\n"
"\n"
"装弹系统比较缓慢，弹夹非常昂贵，可以联射4发子弹。布劳特的阻击效果远远优于任何靠化学反应发射子弹的枪支。它可同时作为狙击步枪和火力武器使用，这取决于是否采用半自动模式或4联射模式。这是一款适合多种环境使用的武器，其战术价值极高。\n"

As a weapon, the combat knife's edge is reinforced with hard ceramics to give it extra armour-piercing power, and it is balanced for throwing should the need arise. It also has a bayonet ring for affixing the knife to the barrel of an old-style battle rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The inclusion of the combat knife in our arsenal was a subject of hot debate. Mumbai has taught us that even in the most favourable conditions, a knife is no match for the aliens' weaponry. If a knife-equipped soldier isn't shot down before he even reaches his target, he will almost certainly be gutted by one of the wicked alien blades that slice right through armour. Only in a handful of occasions have experienced knife-fighters been able to win out against alien opponents.\n"
"\n"
"Still, the combat knife has saved many a life over the years when firearms became inoperable or ran out of ammo. It has never been rendered obsolete by centuries of progressing technology; even the aliens use bladed weapons. When the chips are down, a knife in hand is still vastly better than a man's own fists.\n"

msgid "Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a razor, and yet shock-resistant and flexible enough to survive the stresses of melee combat. Once forged they are nearly impossible to break, nick or bend. Applying a hammer and chisel directly to the blade just means you end up with two neatly-sliced halves of a chisel.\n"

"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"

"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he will have very little warning and in most cases will require special training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his weapon and take aim.\n"

"人类在受到闪光雷冲击的时候会暂时性耳聋并失去平衡，同时还会完全性失明5秒钟，随时间和影响衰减视力和听力会逐渐恢复。闪光雷是非常有用的作战武器，可以延缓敌人的行动，为突袭赢得时间。根据研究分析结果，闪光雷对异形同样有效。但还无法确定效果时间能有多长，不过战场上的每一秒都是非常宝贵的。\n"
"\n"
"作为一个有用的战术工具，闪光雷可以不用担心爆炸范围内是否有自己人。只需闭上眼睛捂住耳朵就可以安全无恙。同样对于敌人来说，如果反应速度够快也可以避免闪光雷的影响，但这一般需要特别的训练才会有极快的反应速度，异形应该没有对此作过专门训练，即便是有过训练，在无预警的突袭情况下，闪光雷还是可以发挥作用。闪光雷对于比较分散的敌人也是有一定效果的。\n"

"建议\n"
"\n"
"闪光雷对任何人都不会造成身体伤害，因此，如果附近有平民使用闪光雷会比使用其他爆炸手雷安全的多。\n"
"\n"
"这是在任何环境下都不可或缺的武器。如果敌人躲在黑暗的角落，冒险直接过去无疑是自杀，而先使用闪光雷就会有不同的局面。其效用是不容低估的。\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Though quite effective against enemy infantry, frag grenades are weapons of opportunity, not a replacement for firearms or portable artillery. Their range is highly limited and their casualty radius is small. However, if the situation calls for close-range indirect fire or something deadly thrown around a corner, the frag grenade is just the thing.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be equipped with at least one grenade of some variety -- be it a frag grenade, flashbang, incendiary grenade or other -- in case the need should arise. Two or more are strongly recommended.\n"

"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 6 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm -- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"这种武器有两种火力模式：延时模式，榴弹会使用慢速引信的方式，往往会在落地反弹后才会爆炸；空爆模式，榴弹会使用快速引信，往往会在击中目标的同时就会爆炸。RA6有半自动联发模式，可以一次发射3枚榴弹。\n"

"空爆模式在开扩地带很有用，虽然它的射程不如“弹跳”的射程，但没有“弹跳”也是有好处的。“弹跳”可能会严重影响准确性，如果地面不平坦就不能达到预期的效果。空爆模式可以精确的控制榴弹在那里爆炸。HPGL的发弹成功率几乎是百分之百。\n"
"\n"
"在巷战情况下，延时模式可以利用墙壁反弹把榴弹发射到危险的角落地带或其他无法直接射击的地方。不过应该注意开要误伤队友。由于反弹速度比手雷大，不确定因素很高，使用不当会造成危险。特别是附近有平民的时候，一定要小心使用。\n"

"For this project, we already had ready access to all the required technology. We've made very few changes to the general design of the grenade. The only real challenge was to shrink the complex machinery enough to fit inside a standard 25mm shell. We've had to scale back the power of the plasma grenade somewhat in order to do that -- the hydrogen core of our new 25mm shell is a fair bit smaller, emitting less plasma than the alien hand grenade. However, this is offset by the fact that it can be fired en masse from our HPGL Grenade Launcher over relatively long distances.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"概况\n"
"\n"
"孟买事件让我们清楚的认识到他们的技术是如此的先进。英联邦军队根本对它们构成不了威胁，他们损失了三个营才只是让异形停止了脚步。PHALANX要获得胜利必须使用人类技术最高的产品。\n"
"\n"
"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"红外夜视成像技术已用于战场上的好几代人了，越来越小的体积使它已经成为一名军人夜间行动的标准佩戴装备。现在的红外成像设备大小和游泳护目镜差不多。\n"
"\n"
"红外护目镜使用红外线扫描前方的区域，然后成像在镜片上。在夜间使用能大大提高士兵的视觉范围，甚至可以透视一些比较薄的建筑。厚的墙壁还没有办法透视。当然，红外透视只能确定有生命活动而无法区分是人类还是异形。\n"
"\n"
"红外护目镜在白天也可以成像，但效果很差。\n"
"\n"
"佩戴护目镜会影响士兵的外围视力，对行动也会有一定的影响，可能还会影响射击的准确性。佩戴时间太长还会损害士兵的视力。更糟糕的是，根据孟买的记录，一些异形不是热血动物。如果只靠护目镜观察四周，这些冷血的异形就会悄声无息的接近我们的士兵。\n"
"\n"
"总之，这些护目镜最好在夜间使用。护目镜永远也无法替代真正的眼睛。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"我们应该在少数战术里使用护目镜，以避免不必要的损失。建议战斗期间最多只有半数的队员佩戴护目镜。一人佩带护目镜一人不带护目镜同时行动才能有最大战场效益。\n"
"\n"
"白天不需要使用护目镜。唯一需要的理由就是用来透视非常薄的墙壁。\n"
"\n"
"护目镜会严重影响近距离作战的准确性。长距离攻击不受此影响，狙击手还可以利用红外激光瞄准来提高精度。\n"

msgid "Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close in terms of power.\n"

"太空刀的分析完成了，长官。这里是总结报告。\n"
"\n"
"太空刀乍一看很像人类使用的战斗刀。但事实并不是如此。\n"
"\n"
"它的制造材料是碳合金和外星塑料，令人惊讶的是没有任何金属成分。这种合成材料性能很好。不管我们怎么测试，都无法对刀身制造出缺口，甚至都无法弯曲。我认为，在这方面我们还需要作更多的研究。\n"
"\n"
"它的形状类似于人类古代历史中的大刀，或者也可以说更像奇幻小说里的兵器。对于人来说它太大了。刀锋非常尖利，令人难以置信的是其最边缘通过衡量我们发现竟然只有一个分子的宽度。这也是太空刀撕裂物体耗力少的原因所在。\n"
"\n"
"在我们的战场摄像纪录里，我们很少看到太空刀的作战使用，似乎这太空刀有其他的特别用途。直到我们完整的分析了孟买录像以后，我们才猜测出这款刀的作用。如果拿人类制品来类比的话，这就是一把手术刀或古老的剔骨刀。\n"
"\n"
"事实上这是个外星解剖工具，用来解剖人类的器官和组织。异形拿着它就像使用开罐器一样把刀头插入到人体下部，然后像剪刀一样划开人的胸骨。对于异形来说这个工具是非常方便的，不仅可以用于解剖还可以用在其他地方。\n"
"\n"
"虽然太空刀不是一把真正意义上的兵器，但它的锋利远远超过任何人类制品。它可以不费力的撕裂异形和人类，但刀身太大了。PHALANX还是把它归到了武器库，但士兵们几乎用不上它，对于人手来说这把刀使用起来太困难。在这一点看来这次研究很不成功，可以说对实战没有任何帮助。\n"

msgid "Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a weaker beam, doing less damage than a larger weapon. It requires a period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate the issue even further. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. The weapon can send out Wave Fire, a short burst, or switched to a Pulse Fire mode for a more sustained and deadly beam.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, its range is quite impressive for a handgun.\n"

"该系统基本上和我以前报告的微型激光系统一样。氘与氟反应产生激光，然后通过一系列智能反射镜头发射出去。我们降低了产生的废气，并使用了较小的过滤系统。不过这也带来了部分损失。\n"
"\n"
"激光手枪的激光强度只有以前的一半左右。伤害也就损失了一半。激光需要连续照射好几秒钟才能造成足够的伤害来杀死不穿护甲的目标。着甲的目标会更困难。但是，只要有足够的照射激光可以穿透任何装甲。另一个缺点是，激光无法穿透烟雾，气体和火焰。\n"

"From a technical standpoint, the electrolaser works on almost the same principles as natural lightning.

"Electrolasers are a tried and true concept on Earth. They have a history of use going back several decades as less-than-lethal weapons. At their most basic, they are a 'taser without the wires', but until now they've suffered serious limitations due to battery capacity and the power levels required to knock out a soldier in insulated body armour. For this reason they've only ever been developed practically as single-shot disposables and close-range civilian weapons. Thanks to the output of our deuterium-fluoride lasers and energy systems, though, we've been able to go a lot further than that.\n"
"\n"
"Our electrolaser can project a stable plasma channel at short to medium ranges, depending on atmospheric conditions, and deliver previously unheard-of voltages to the target. It is effective against both organic and robotic enemies.

I'm afraid this means that ammunition for the electrolaser is NOT interchangeable with ammunition for our regular laser weaponry.\n"

"Technical Document, Delta Clearance\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"概况\n"
"\n"
"在过去的战争中，紧急救护有很多局限性。士兵往往看到其他人受伤也只能继续战斗，没有其他更多的选择，只能期望医务人员能及时赶到，最多也只能对小伤口做简单的包扎。受伤的士兵在这种情况及时存活下来，也会在医务所休息好几周甚至好几个月才能再次返回战场。\n"
"\n"
"自第二次世界大战以后，急救技术得到了很快的发展。在对士兵作简单培训以后，很多简单的医疗措施和设备都能及时在战场上发挥作用了。这就是现代急救包的效用。\n"
"\n"
"每个急救包都有一台微型电脑，可以用来进行X光和超声波检查。同时还可以分析心电图和脑电波，测量血压和心率，甚至还可以根据士兵的个人资料（每个士兵手臂都植有一个储存芯片）来估算他的战斗力。所有这些信息可以显示成小全息图像或直接连接士兵的头盔信息系统。与此同时急救包还配备了各种药品和一些无菌手术工具以及纳米机器人，必要时可以给伤员作紧急手术。\n"
"\n"
"在30年前，越南的研究人员第一次成功的把医疗纳米机器人用于临床手术。今天，医学技术已经发展到不可思议的地步。纳米机器人的大小只有几个微米，可以自由的在人体内活动。他们可以给伤口消毒，可以缝合破裂的动脉，可以结扎出血的微动脉，可以修复肠胃穿刺，可以移除坏死组织甚至还可以修复损伤的神经。一旦电池耗尽它们就会自动分解到血液里。它们的存活时间很短，往往不会超过10-15秒，所以对于重伤员来说它们不是很有效。急救包一般配备两个剂量以上的纳米机器人。不管多少数量的纳米机器人都不会对人体造成任何不良影响。\n"
"\n"
"这项技术对于外科手术来说是最重要的创造发明。它可以让受伤的士兵发上恢复。不过要注意的是，如果受伤的是重要器官或其他等等严重的情况，急救包也只能提供必要的急救处理手段，他并不能完全代替真正的手术室。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"我们所有的士兵都已通过急救训练。理论上每个士兵都应该携带一个急救包以备万一，但实际情况下，我们士兵的负重是有限的。士兵一旦受伤，就应该立即对主要伤口作紧急处理，以防止并发症等风险，如果伤者还能移动，那应该立即撤出火线，找一处安全的地方由他人协助进行仔细的治疗。\n"
"\n"
"急救包的药品还有用于昏迷士兵的清醒剂。当然急救包的使用都是要靠其他人，伤者自身无法对自己使用。担负医疗员角色的士兵需要靠近伤者才能治疗，这一般都很危险，请注意火力掩护，在尽可能的情况下治疗最好远离火线。\n"
"\n"
"一旦受伤的士兵能活着返回基地，我们的医疗小组将接管治疗。基本上PHALANX医务所可以治愈任何伤者，这里我们可以保证做到这一点。\n"

"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two 'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is not very far, but its appropriate for a secondary weapon.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual for human use. Our soldiers will now be able to employ the plasma pistol in a combat scenario as they would any other weapon.\n"

"\n"
"和一般枪支不一样的是，没有什么东西专门存放发射的“弹药”，只有一个装置里有电力盒以及部分氢原料。融合产生的等离子体在枪膛里被塑料液体薄膜包裹，悬浮在枪膛发射仓，当达到一定程度后，就会像球一样发射出去。塑料液体薄膜直到等离子体接触目标以后才会分裂，整个过程就像一个肥皂泡，破裂以后等离子体会飞溅四散。它的有效射程不长，只有约20米。\n"

msgid "Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"

"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a ratio that neither PHALANX nor humanity can possibly afford. Even if it was closer to 10: 1 I still wouldn't fancy our chances. After all, how many of them are there?\n"

"长官，我们已经彻底的研究了这款神秘的外星武器。恐怕我带来的消息并不乐观。\n"
"\n"
"我们都错了，这不是一把简单的刀。从本质上讲，它是一种反装甲武器，就像二战里的反坦克手雷发射器，只是设计的目标不是反坦克而是反装甲步兵和小型装甲车。\n"
"\n"
"它的形状像一把刀但没有刀片。在应该是刀片的位置上有一个塑料环绕的黑色小喷嘴。没有明显的触发或激活开关。当它被按进一定长度以后就会喷出。这就是“刀片”。\n"
"\n"
"同时喷嘴周围的塑料也会随即变硬，强度达到混凝土的强度，和接触的表面形成一个密闭的真空，从而使武器牢牢的固定在目标上。与此同时，武器内部的高温等离子体会沿着喷嘴以极快的速度穿透目标射入体内。\n"
"\n"
"没有任何装甲可以抵挡这种武器。换句话说就是被打中的目标就肯定会死。等离子刀的唯一缺点就是如果使用投掷方式会非常的不准确，不过实际上很少会使用到投掷方式，往往都是近距离直接刺杀。如果异形挥舞着等离子刀冲入我们的队伍，那整支队伍都处于危险之中。一定要在敌人靠近以前消灭敌人，否则后果不堪设想。\n"
"\n"
"长官，我很担忧，这种武器的存在意味着很多事情。结合异形对生命的态度来看，我可以认为它们完全不怕死，在战场上可能会使用像神风特攻队那样的战术，牺牲自己的生命只是为了要杀死我们中的一员。一换一对于PHALANX来说是不可能承受的。即使比例是10: 1也不是可以接受的。究竟，它们有多少这样的敢死队呢？\n"

"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard human frag grenade.\n"
"\n"
"Anything caught within the area of effect will be either severely injured or dead.\n"

"We've drawn up a set of blueprints that will allow our Workshops to begin immediate construction, and a manual to train our soldiers in its use. They will now be able to use the plasma grenade as any other grenade in our arsenal.\n"

msgid "Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma shots are much thicker than the pistol's, giving them a greater range before disintegrating. This is a short maximum range for a general-purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes it an accurate weapon, but its unusual design makes it more difficult for our soldiers to aim than the standard-issue assault rifles they are used to.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high and the recoil is difficult to handle, but it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to burn through light or medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

"长官，这里是外星等离子步枪的研究报告。\n"

"从基本层面来说，等离子步枪是一个加强版的等离子手枪。然而，任何一个枪支迷都会告诉你，手枪是手枪，步枪是步枪。手枪体积小主要是个人自卫武器。而步枪是战争武器。这种差距是很大的。\n"
"\n"
"等离子步枪的威力比等离子手枪大20％，可以击透重型装甲。步枪等离子弹的外裹塑料也厚于手枪，射出80米后才会开始解体。这是等离子步枪的最大射程，但足以应付城市里的战斗。由于等离子弹的质量变大了，外界风力影响也就不是那么重要了，这使得等离子步枪的精度也大大提高了不少。\n"
"\n"
"这支步枪还有一个特点，它可以全自动发射。全自动模式的射速不是很高，每分钟约180发，而且反冲也很大，但火力上的优势弥补了这些缺陷。等离子步枪的一到两次开火就可以杀死一个穿轻中级别的装甲的士兵。对于没有防护的士兵只要一发就足以致命。\n"
"\n"
"我们已经掌握了这款步枪的仿制技术，也给士兵们编写了操作手册。我们的士兵现在可以在战场上像其他武器一样熟练的使用等离子步枪。\n"

"\n"

Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist.

"Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to flank whilst staying out of sight.

A hundred years ago, the energy efficiency of coilguns measured less than 2%; meaning, the energy of the projectile at the time of impact was less than 2% of the energy used to fire it. Even with today's technology coilgun efficiency is limited to single digits, but the alien Needler manages efficiency ratings as high as 70%. It may take us years to get to that level, but with the Coilgun we've developed something that is both practical and effective for the war effort.\n"
"\n"
"In order to get better acceleration out of the coils, we've created a new kind of ammunition, based on the aliens' needle alloy. In shape it's a fairly standard fin-stabilised penetrator inside a discarding sabot, but it's made from materials never before seen on Earth. Discarding sabot rounds are normally used for much larger calibres -- we've effectively scaled down an anti-tank round -- but the armour-piercing potential is phenomenal, higher than any other weapon we have. In fact, the Coilgun is now the highest-calibre infantry weapon on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"We've also incorporated a Needler-style holographic sight, making the Coilgun extremely accurate and comfortable to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of a coilgun as a sniper rifle are obvious. There's no rush of propellant to make noise, no muzzle flash spitting out light and heat. Unlike even our Bolter, nothing comes out the barrel except the bullet -- there's no spray of hot metal from the rails to light up the sniper on infrared. With nothing to reveal the sniper's position except the noise of the bullet itself breaking the sound barrier, it's possible to fire and stay undetected, even against alien technology. Best of all, ballistics tests confirm that it should be able to bring down most aliens in a single shot.\n"
"\n"
"Of course we've had to make some sacrifices -- high weight due to the coils and electrical equipment contained in the barrel, low ammunition capacity due to the high calibre, large and heavy magazines/power packs.

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one despite its relative bulk. It is a good choice for snipers or anyone who needs a powerful backup for close range engagements.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese government. Production models were only trickling into government units by the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew through a 30-round magazine in two seconds. It fires an upgraded version of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly 50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known design flaw.\n"

"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification CRC-8.\n"
"\n"

"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"

There is no vision system that cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the LRWS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"LRWS和其他现代狙击步枪相比最大的优点是枪支较短，而且令人难以置信的轻，还可发射20毫米重机枪子弹。其独特的枪膛尾部几乎完全是由钨钛合金制作，可以承受大口径子弹点火时带来的巨大冲力。由于设计目的主要用于城市环境所以其枪管较短，LRWS的有效射程大约为1公里－几乎是标准反器材步枪的三分之一－但我们估计PHALANX不会遇到射程不够的情况。其准确性很高，可以自动计算并显示步枪瞄准方向的子弹轨迹。\n"
"\n"
"悬架系统采用了智能脚架，可以自动调节枪支的平衡，还能根据射击模式细微调整，使得精确性更为出色。最重要的是，这种步枪在孟买的实战中取得了比其他任何武器更为优异的成绩。\n"
"\n"
"由于重量轻体积小LWRS具有很高的灵活性，完全可以满足我们的需要。这款武器绝对不会令人失望。\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX使用的是S－1型阻击步枪。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"配备S－1的士兵应该注意保持距离，尽量使用瞄准射击。这不是一款自动武器，任何一次未命中都是浪费时间和弹药甚至还有生命。\n"
"\n"
"我们所有的狙击手都应该至少配备一个备用武器，如P－12或CRC－8，最差也要有把刺刀。狙击手附近出现了异形，他应立即准备好备用武器。在任何情况下，他应该尝试使用了S－1来抵抗近距离威胁。S－1的速度太慢，有时无法阻止敌人快速靠近。如果只使用S－1来防御而不准备好备用武器，那等到敌人靠近以后再掏出备用武器那将为时已晚。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"注解\n"
"\n"
"该武器和火箭发射器及榴弹发射器是为数不多的可以有效打击异形的地球武器。"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide airtight coverage of the soldier's body.\n"
"\n"
"We've created a delivery system in the form of a standard throwable canister. Our troops should experience no problems using this item in the field.\n"

"我们在生化武器的研究上已经取得了初步的成果。有一种反应剂可以有效的在战场上发挥作用，您随时都可以将这个投入战场。\n"
"\n"
"反应剂是漂白剂，芥子气，四氯化钛和其他一些有毒化合物混合产生的一种物质，我们称它为CHOKE。如果皮肤接触到它，短短几秒钟内就会发生作用。它可以分散到空气里，并能有几分钟的有效覆盖期。\n"
"\n"
"它对有机组织的伤害很大。即使是轻微的接触，皮肤或粘膜都会受到严重的刺激，从而造成呼吸困难和痛苦感。如果接触到眼睛则可能会造成长期失明，如果不及时治疗则会永久失明。CHOKE造成的疼痛刺激极大，可以使任何接触到它的生物失去行动能力。在对异形囚犯的测试上表现的非常突出，大多数时候异形直接就休克了，几乎很少出现可以活动的情况，直到使用了止痛药或抗CHOKE药物异形才能恢复过来。异形的呼吸器具根本无法防护这种反应剂。\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE同样对人类也是有效的。对志愿人员测试的时候，被测试者直接躺倒在地上几乎无法呼吸。幸好及时进行了抢救，测试人员才得以存活。建议使用CHOKE的时候我们的人员一定要远离目标区。当然我们也给我们自己的部队提供了部分药物用以治疗受CHOKE伤害的士兵。\n"
"\n"
"防御CHOKE的唯一方法就是全身封闭。迄今为止，我们还没有发现异形有这样的全封闭装甲可以防御这种攻击。至于PHALANX的作战部队，只要使用防毒面具头盔就可以得到保护，因为我们的标准作战服都是全身覆盖的。\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"电击眩晕的原理基本上不用做深入的介绍。这是一个电子武器，它的前端叉子可以提供极高的脉冲电击。强度大的足以使目标昏迷，甚至还可以毁坏外星机器人的电子线路。同样这个武器对人类也是有效的。使用的时候请务必小心。\n"
"\n"
"使用方法非常简单。只需将它的前端叉子接触到敌人的皮肤或装甲，然后抠动扳机就可以了。即使目标有盔甲或防护外皮也会被电晕。当然实际效果还会受目标的精神状态等等影响。准确的数字恐怕我无法提供。不过，我估计，只要多电几次，就肯定可以让目标没有任何行动能力。\n"
"\n"
"这款电子武器本身比较脆弱，不过我们使用太空刀的材料对它作了加固，在混战情况下，也不会出现断裂或失效。\n"
"\n"
"不幸的是，由于重型电池和额外加固材料的缘故，电击棒的尺寸就变得非常大。需要两只手才能有效地在战斗中使用它，不过它并不会妨碍到无法单手使用手雷或手枪。\n"
"\n"
"这款电击棒可以反复使用，它可以算是地球上最强大的电击武器。不过它只能近战使用，对于远程眩晕武器我们还没有任何可用的技术。电击棒本身的电能储存只够在一场战斗中使用有限的几次。我们已经开始考虑使用外星电池，不过这还需要作很多研究才行。\n"

"I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I have an important technical research proposal to make, a proposal to create a new piece of PHALANX equipment for use by our field agents. I realise this falls outside the responsibilities of my division. However, I've already discussed things with Cdr. Navarre, and he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with me on the necessity of the item in question. I had no choice but to go to straight to you with the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical engagements in all the weeks we've been waging this war. Now that we know how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a serious impediment to our biological and chemical research. We need living tissue to study, performing its natural functions inside a living body, and we don't have the ability to simply clone up some aliens to research. We need prisoners. The sooner the better.\n"
"\n"
"That's why I would like to propose a simple but high-powered electrical shock weapon, not unlike a military stun gun, designed to disable our enemies without killing them. It would be a two-handed man-portable unit with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which should be sufficient even to disable alien robots such as the Bloodspider. We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be disabled long enough for our soldiers to take control of the situation and secure prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our soldiers and \"a throwback to the 20th century\", and refuses to endorse it. He doesn't seem to understand. We have no alternative method of disabling enemies at the voltages required. Commander, we need this weapon as badly as we need live aliens from the field. We can't merely shoot them and hope to patch one or two up again upon return to base. Even if we succeeded in that mindset, my division's needs will be far, far higher than that for proper research and interrogation.\n"
"\n"
"I hope you understand. Please authorise lab time and funding for this project as soon as you can, and I'll get some people from DivEngine together to develop this project properly. I would of course be delighted if you could explain things to Cdr. Navarre. I'm sure he'll be happy to receive a message from you.\n"

"正如你所知，这场战争已经打了好几个星期了，可我们还没有抓获任何一个活的异形。现在我们已经知道如何维持它们的生命了，可我们手里没有活的标本来继续更进一步的研究。我们需要活的异形，而不是尸体。\n"
"\n"
"这就是为什么我会有这个提案的原因，我们希望能设计出一个简单的高功率电击武器，可以瘫痪敌人而无需杀死他们。这将是一种双手单兵武器，其作用甚至应该可以瘫痪外星机器人，如血蜘蛛。我们的工程部认为，任何受到这种武器攻击的生物都会瘫痪很久，不会影响我们士兵的战斗，使他们有足够时间在战斗结束以后再处理这些被瘫痪的囚犯。\n"

"\n"
"The rifle seems to follow a very basic, modular design, quite unlike the plasma weapons we've already observed. All the parts can be slotted in or out of the weapon just by pressing an appropriately-located release catch. Strangely, none of the weapon's parts are particularly high-tech or impressive, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the weapon's ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our infantry armour. The high-energy particles in a particle beam travel so fast that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle armour. When fired at a suit of Combat Armour, the results are gruesome. It penetrates the front of the armour without even slowing down, and still has enough power to punch out the back and continue for several metres before dispersing.\n"
"\n"
"Much heavier protection will be required for our troops to be able to stand up to this kind of fire. In addition to the development of entirely new armours, we should look into upgrading our current suits as soon as possible. We may suffer significant troop losses to alien PB weapons if we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, the rifle's shape is not at all suited to the human body, and even with adaptations it will be poorly balanced for human shooters. If deployed with our squads, our accuracy won't be as good as the aliens.\n"

msgid "Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to take advantage of it.\n"

"\n"
"每个弹夹其实是一个微型同步粒子加速器，我们根本无法想象它们是如何建造它的。该加速器的加速管道直径略小于弹夹的直径。原子粒子在加速到一定速度以后，内部的磁场矩阵会自动重新排列，然后这些粒子就会被约束在一起形成粒子光束。\n"
"\n"
"长官，这么复杂的微型加速器估计在我有生之年是造不出来的。全地球现在也没有这项技术。粒子束武器的结构很简单，但其核心技术我们根本无法理解和学习。如果我们要真正使用这些粒子束武器，那我们就必须使用外星弹药。更糟糕的是，这些微型加速器的使用寿命好像很短，只用了几次就会开始发生故障。我们的弹药供应将会极不稳定，一切都取决于我们能从战场上缴获多少弹夹。\n"
"\n"
"我无法告诉你为什么这种武器在战争开始的时候没有出现。外星战争机器明显要优于我们好几个数量级。它们的技术更先进，它们有更多的士兵和更好的飞机，但它们至今也只是和我们缠斗。这令人感到困惑。但是，任何一个优秀的士兵都会告诉你，“为什么”并不重要。这些决策上的失误我们一定要加以利用。\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
"\n"
"Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider silk.\n"
"\n"
"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the extra mobility.\n"

"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"盔甲在战场上从来没有真正消失过，尽管在18世纪初到20世纪末它没有什么作用。在第一次世界大战的盔甲的概念转变成了钢盔。直到第二次世界大战结束，合成纤维防弹衣才真正成了盔甲的替代品。到了今天，合成纤维防弹衣已经彻底过时，只有一些预算不足的警察部队还在使用。更先进的防弹衣采用了新的材料，比以往任何防弹衣都更有效。\n"
"\n"
"令人吃惊的是，在PHALANX的旧档案里我们发现这方面的发展竟然是PHALANX推动的。2017年PHALANX太平洋作战基地的研究员制造了人造蜘蛛丝，这一技术到目前仍然在使用。大规模生产用的“有机”纺织机可以同时拉伸几百条丝腺。\n"
"\n"
"用人造蜘蛛丝制造护身服是在2023年，在随后的战争中实践效果远远优于老式的合成纤维防弹衣。设计采用了人造蜘蛛丝和超高分子聚乙烯，成品的灵活性非常好。其强度相当于钢铁的18倍，性能比老式合成纤维提高了400％。新式护身服很快在全球得到了广泛的欢迎。现在的护身服是新的改进版，正面和背面都可以插入陶瓷或金属，防护能力进一步的提高了。\n"
"\n"
"作战服的唯一缺点是比一般衣服重，由于有若干层防护所以重量是无法减轻的。不过整套衣服重量均匀分布，灵活性极好，和没有穿戴一样。作战服是士兵的重要装备，它能保护生命安全。\n"

"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our production design is geared towards maximum protection. It is, in a nutshell, an airtight suit of armour with servo-assisted joints and an on-board control system. The outer skin is a flexible three-layer composite, with outer layers consisting of nanotube-fullerene fabric, and an inner layer of special polymer gel, mixed with Wolfram-Molybdene powder. When the outer layer of the composite is burned, the gel evaporates instantly, dissipating the heat, and the metal powder will create a cloud around the damaged area, thus creating a local bloom effect that will consume much of the energy.\n"

"The inside consists of a thick layer of memory gel covered by an electrically sensitive lining. The gel allows the suit to be fitted to a range of heights and body shapes, so hopefully we shouldn't have to custom-build every suit to fit one specific soldier. The inner lining is an important part of the control system; it detects nerve impulses through the wearer's skin, interprets these signals, and uses them to predict the wearer's movements before they're made. This allows the suit to move simultaneously with the body rather than resisting the user's movements.\n"

msgid "Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or 'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour using the alien suit as a template.

"异形装甲采用碳纳米管作渗透层，用于阻挡子弹及其他弹药。碳纳米管以格子模式覆盖在硬聚合物上，其后是半液体凝胶层，可以非常有效地抑制动能的打击和传播。最后一层是合成纤维，用于防止裂开和阻挡子弹碎片。\n"
"\n"
"由于碳纳米管的导电性能，等离子和激光的伤害也能有很好的防护。不过讽刺的是，它对火的防护能力极差，几乎没有任何作用。\n"
"\n"
"装甲的其他特点还包括一个辅助运动鞋，可以提高穿戴者的移动速度，其内置的护腕可以调节运动鞋的局部压力以及部分前臂的局部压力。对于这项技术我们正在寻找到新的用途。\n"
"\n"
"这套装甲人类无法直接穿戴，毕竟体形差异太大。不过，我提草一份新的研究建议，开发类似的适合人类使用的装甲。\n"

This armour has been a plague to our soldiers due to its very high resistance to various types of damage; aliens wearing it have shrugged off shots that would have torn their unarmoured friends apart.

msgid "Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so many nanotubes at once.\n"

"\n"
"Filed: 16 February 1958\n"
"\n"
"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The first priority of the Extraterrestrial Response Unit is to prepare for a time when it may be needed. The PHALANX Containment Facility is an important part of any invasion response plan. It contains atmospheric habitation chambers, interrogation machinery, nutrition distribution units, and all the other apparatus required to sustain any extraterrestrial life that we could comprehend.\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to store and keep extraterrestrials (EXT) for a significant period of time. Their atmosphere generators are capable of pumping any individual chamber full of any desired mix of gases. This can provide an EXT with breathable air for at least several weeks, well beyond the expected lifespan for a specimen in our research programs. Trace elements that do not occur naturally on Earth may be difficult to come by, but the likelihood of this becoming an impediment to our research is infinitessimal. In a worst-case scenario, the atmosphere generators are designed to allow links to recovered life support equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, waldo-operated medical and interrogation apparatus is present in each habitation chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other chemical injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer electroshocks for interrogation purposes. There is also a so-called \"panic button\" installed on each chamber individually and in the control room for every block of chambers. The panic button can immediately incinerate the contents of its chamber during an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"The chambers and corridors of the Containment Facility are specially designed to allow EXTs of any shape and size to be transported and held. The facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples for later review.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, the Containment Unit should be used to its full extent, storing both live and dead EXTs for research and allowing us to examine them in their living state. There is no greater priority than the discovery of the thought processes of the extraterrestrial mind, to learn their motivations and perhaps find a compromise, an opportunity for communication, or a suitable counterstrategy to neutralise the enemy once and for all.\n"
"\n"
"If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration should be given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment Facility. Unless there are irreplaceable specimens in storage, we cannot risk the attacking EXTs freeing their captured comrades. Immediate and complete sedation is another, more risky strategy -- however, I stress that we will not win a war with half measures.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"To whatever future Commanders might be reviewing this file: Keep in mind that the machinery in the Containment Facility, like a fair portion of PHALANX equipment, has yet to undergo its true acid test against an extraterrestrial force. Upgrades or adjustments may be required for it to perform up to its design spec."

"\n"
"首先，大气生存室能储存和维持外星人一段时间。气体发生机能够产生任何元素为成分的混合气体。这至少可以维持一个外星人几个星期，在我们的实验里样本存活时间远远超出了预期。地球上没有的微量元素可能会造成困难来的，但这对我们不是问题。\n"
"\n"
"其次，每个生存室都有审讯和观察设备，可以将镇静药物或其他化学注射液直接通过气动飞镖发射器给异形注射，还有有电击功能的等等设备。在中央控制室，还设有紧急按钮，在必要的时候，就可以直接焚毁生存室里的任何东西。\n"

"在战争中，收容所可能会非常有用，不管死的还是或的外星生物对我们都有研究价值。活的生命研究，可以使我们对它们的动机有更多的了解，同时或许有机会和它们交流，进而找到一种可以永远瓦解敌人的方法。\n"

"\n"
"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble for whatever I say here. Just for the record, the bastarding SecDef can get buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base does get attacked, defending the CC should be a top priority, because without it we will be unable to put up any kind of effective fight until it can be repaired.\n"

"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"

"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have gotten more and more dangerous since World War 2, while countermeasure technologies have only been becoming effective since the start of the 21st century. In a contest between attack and defence, the attacker has always had the advantage. However, this has not deterred the aliens from developing defences to blow our minds.\n"
"\n"
"As an example, GEU forces have engaged alien craft with SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles) in the skies above Bonn. Forty missiles were launched from batteries across Europe while they had radar lock on two of the alien craft. Later, nearby infantry units fired between twelve and fifteen shoulder-mounted anti-air weapons.\n"
"\n"
"The number of hits scored? One. Just one. The UFO suffered a minor drop in acceleration during its landing at Bonn and later took off again without a hitch.\n"
"\n"
"The conclusions are obvious: alien EW (Electronic Warfare) capability is miles in advance of our own. However, we at PHALANX have made a thorough study of the sole hit scored, and it was not a matter of luck. What happened is that the UFO exposed itself at a less stealthy angle while dodging other incoming munitions, allowing the missile to hold lock all the way to its target.\n"
"\n"
"This proves that the aliens are not invulnerable to our missiles. We simply need the best ones for the job. These realisations have led us to adapt some old missile battery plans and reequip them with brand-new launchers. Our results are promising.\n"
"\n"
"The battery consists of 4 launchers that 'pop up' to the surface when engaging a target. Each launcher carries 20 of the AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. This is the most advanced missile on Earth, packing more electronics than an airliner, designed to knock enemy aircraft right out of the sky regardless of how fast they're going. There is no better emergency defence weapon on the planet at the time of this writing.\n"
"\n"
"Against alien craft, the \"Cicada\"'s chances to hit will still be low, but in sufficient numbers it will hurt them. The missile and its electronics suite are of course highly expensive, well outside our budget range in the numbers required to succesfully engage incoming UFOs. Fortunately the UN has agreed to supply us all standard SAMs from its own strategic reserves at no cost to us.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"If built at one of our bases, the missile battery can be ordered to engage any UFO in range or wait until a UFO is identified as preparing to attack the base in question. This decision is up to the Base Commander. Assisting our interceptors by 'softening up' a UFO with SAMs would help take some of the pressure off our pilots and aircraft, but there is simply no way to completely hide our missile launches despite our best attempts to camouflage them. Repeated large-scale launches will give away our position sooner or later.\n"
"\n"
"The missile battery will be at moderate risk during a base attack. It is designed to prevent base attacks; if one has gotten through, it should no longer matter to the current attackers unless they're paving the way for a follow-up. It may be a tempting target of opportunity, however, because while our missiles are well-protected they will detonate if subjected to enough abuse. An explosion in the missile battery could have disastrous effects on the facility and the base at large.\n"

"\n"
"就拿GEU部队在波恩用地对空飞弹打击异形飞船举例来说，当雷达锁定2架异形飞船的时候，欧洲各地发射了40枚地对空飞弹，附近的地面部队发射了12-15枚肩式防空飞弹。\n"

"这套装置有4个联动发射器，打击目标的时候，4个会同时发射并互相协调。每一套装置可以容纳20个AA51蝉式地对空飞弹。这是地球上最先进的导弹，上面的电子装备比一架客机还多，不管敌机速度有多快都能锁定，没有其他同类型武器能够与之媲美。\n"
"\n"
"对付异形飞船，该飞弹命中机会还是很低。不过数量多的时候还是有效的。导弹和电子套件当然是非常昂贵，如果要成功的攻击来袭的UFO，所需的资金远远超过我们的预算经费。幸好，联合国同意从他们的战略石油储备中支付我们建设这个标准设施。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"如果基地有个飞弹发射仓，如何决定何时发射导弹是个值得注意的问题。是在UFO一靠近基地进入导弹攻击范围就开始发射导弹，还是等UFO被确定为准备袭击基地的时候再发射？这一决定全靠该基地指挥官。协助我们的航空机拦截UFO将有助于减轻我们飞行员的一些压力，但根本无法完全掩盖我们发射导弹，尽管我们使用了最好的伪装。多次大规模的发射将迟早暴露基地的位置。\n"
"\n"
"在基地遭到攻击的时候，飞弹发射仓应该不会是重要的目标。它只是是为了防止基地受到袭击，如果敌人已经进入基地，那它应该不再有作用，除非敌人还有后续的进攻行动。它可以作为一个诱人的目标来吸引敌人的注意，但是，如果在飞弹发射仓展开防御，在敌人攻击的时候可以会引爆发射装置。飞弹发射仓的爆炸极有可能对我们的设施和基地产生灾难性影响。\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"\n"
"如果可能的话，在基地遭到攻击前，所有的航空机飞机应紧急起飞，并撤出该地区，直到结束。当然这样也可能会被UFO盯上，但至少航空机的优势在于能够离地。不过，这不一定是一种可行的策略。我们的航空机可能被全副武装的UFO击毁有时不见得比将其留在机用平台作为诱人的目标来分散敌人目标更划算。\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the Hospital immediately.\n"

"长官，战争将会非常可怕。为了治疗在战场上受重伤的人员，我们需要更先进的设备，而不是一般民用或军用医院使用的那种。这一点是显而易见的，孟买的医院数百人不必要的丧生，就是因为那里没有适当的设备可以治疗外星武器的等离子伤害。我们必须做好更充分的准备。\n"
"\n"
"旧的PHALANX医务所设计严重不足，根本无法应付这场灾难。自从在1960年创造建医务所以来他们从来没有更新过，那些设备根本派不上用处。到最后，我们只好自己重新设计，幸好有纳瓦拉司令官和建设专家的帮忙。我真是不知道那些人对未知外星武器的伤害是怎么预期的。\n"
"\n"
"现在我们的医务所设备是世界上最好的。我们治疗伤口特别是清理和再生烧焦的肌肉组织有超前的技术。我们采用受伤肉体的自我再生技术来强化治疗，其中包括了特效药品、电子神经和肌肉刺激，并使用纳米机器人直接进入伤口输液。从理论上讲，任何伤员在六个星期内都能完全恢复。这还包括心理上的治疗。当然轻伤患者只需更少的时间就能全愈。\n"
"\n"
"我们还可以做截肢和仿生手术。强大的人工肢体已经可以供应世界各地的部队，这包括装甲躯干笼、电子眼和其他人工肢体。在医务所我们可以给我们的士兵安装这些部件，来提高其作战效能，前提当然是我们能够负担起，这个手术的疗养时间是比较长的。\n"

"医务所需要不间断的电力供应。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"每个有武装反应部队的基地都应建造医务所来治疗伤兵。如果没有PHALANX医务所，士兵们将不得不去普通的医疗机构治疗，很有可能会导致永久丧失能力，甚至死亡。\n"
"\n"
"人工肢体移植提升的效果是显而易见的。这些手术只能给健康的人做，另外手术后需要花很长时间来训练并疗养新的身体部件才能真正发挥作用。请记住躯体移植或更换电子眼可能会对士气产生负面影响。\n"
"\n"
"在战术上，医务所不太会受到敌人重视。异形可能会试图杀害我们的伤员和破坏我们的医疗设备，但这显然不太可能，有太多其他目标比医务所更重要。当然，如果我们受到攻击，一名附近警卫应立即在医务所发出警告。\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"

"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and 700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX在1955年开始设想建立能够满足大量需要的能源供给。老基地被迫通过好几百公里的电线来使用大型电力厂、水坝等的电力来满足自身的需求，他们完全依赖于外部环境，经常会遇到电网故障而导致运作瘫痪。随后的革新是俄罗斯的核技术，不少地下基地一直使用这项技术，直到高能裂变技术的发现。\n"
"\n"
"我们的能源动力采用的是德国HEFR（高能裂变反应堆），一个非常高效的能源放大器设计。这是一个临界反应堆，反应堆产生核裂变引发的不是持久的连锁反应，而是引发一个外部的中子源（粒子加速器）的刺激反应。这种方法释放的力量足够使粒子加速器运作，从而产生动力盈余，以供其它基地设施使用。\n"
"\n"
"HEFR使用的是钍而不是铀，其产生的放射性自然衰变周期只有500多年。相比之下，最常用于核武器和旧式反应堆的半衰期同位素钚（钚239）是24110年，铀（铀235）是七亿年。设计中特别采用了这种短周期的燃料，并开发了相应的废料处理系统。经过充分利用和后期处理，HEFR核反应堆废料将只需要几个星期就可以衰变到对人类安全的放射性水平。\n"
"\n"
"在我们的设计中，运作的反应堆堆芯是深藏在一种远离地表的特殊外壳之中。基地内部只有冷却水箱和控制装置。\n"
"\n"
"一个动力能源的输出功率一般能满足标准的需求。如果一个基地配备有许多高耗能建筑物，如研究所、工场等等，或许会需要更多的能源。我们设计能够很容易的安全储存足够的燃料提供10年的持续运作。每个动力室都安装了受保护的燃料容器，在必要时可以补充燃料。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"每个基地至少需要一个动力室。如果没有一个动力室，许多设施-包括司令部-都无法运作。高消耗的基地可能需要使用两个或两个以上的动力室才能使所有的设施充分运作。\n"
"\n"
"我们的基地防卫战略应特别注意维护动力室。损坏冷却水箱可能是灾难性的，如果我们失去太多冷却崩溃将难以避免。我们可能会考虑在被攻击的时候丢弃核反应堆，但它需要很长的时间才能再次运作，在这期间，我们将无法操作任何能源密集型设备。像雷达、研究所设备，甚至平台升降机。\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close -- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"居住区提供20间有卫生设施的个人宿舍和其他住宿房间。\n"

"\n"
"上层都是个人宿舍，一般分配给特定人员。每一个私人宿舍都有自己的床、书桌、储物柜和独立淋浴卫生间。另外还有一个公共健身房。这一层位于地面，有充足的自然阳光。\n"

"在紧急情况下，居住区有特殊的分区设计以及专用避难所。避难所可以保护人员安全，直到危险解除，储存的氧气和生活用品可以支持12个人一周的需要。避难所的出口采用钨增强钛设计，足以抵挡小型的核爆炸。\n"
"\n"
"居住区是独立运作，无需其他设施支持。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"在发生袭击的时候，居住区是基地的一个重要疏散点。在警报拉响以后，所有非作战人员都应放弃当前的工作，并立即撤退到最近的安全点，像司令部、居住区或其他适当的地点。七分钟后，所有安全点大门都将强行关闭--不管是不是全部人员都已到位--并且严禁从内部打开。\n"
"\n"
"从战术角度看居住区这个设施几乎是毫无价值，最有可能被敌人忽略。同时也很廉价和易于维修。除非敌人要把整个基地摧毁，居住区才可能会被彻底毁坏。\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a mass of civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will not increase the extent of our radar coverage. A single facility will cover its full range as effectively as possible, and the only way to increase performance and range is to upgrade our systems with future technology or to build further installations outside the base.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"指挥官，我们已经升级了旧的雷达设施。旧的文档已经不适用了，所以我提交了这份新的文档。\n"
"\n"
"我们的雷达室本身不是一个大的雷达阵列。它实际上是一个控制中心，控制布置在基地以外的一系列伪装的碟形设施。每套设备有8至12个碟形设施，根据现有的空间数目有所调整。每个碟形设施配有多种手段的检测设备而不是简单的雷达，雷达很难维持锁定一个外星来的目标。辅助设备包括，红外线探测和激光测距等等。\n"
"\n"
"在我们电脑收集所有辨别信息数据并处理后，全天候6小时轮班制的工作人员将对数据进行分析。人工监控是绝对必要的，并且应该是不间断的。电脑毕竟不是人脑，缺少本能和经验，出错在所难免，忽略任何一次外星攻击的后果都会导致很多人的死伤。\n"
"\n"
"在一个基地建设一个以上的雷达室将不会有更好的雷达覆盖效果。一个基地一个雷达室就足够了，只有改进系统或提高技术以及建立其他的基地，才能扩展我们雷达覆盖范围。\n"
"\n"
"我们的系统和联合国的飞行资料库有直接连接，可以识别任何有记录的民用飞行物。非PHALANX的军事部队也有相应的连接线路，不过我们不能确保秘密的军事活动是否也能有记录。\n"
"\n"
"如果没有司令部和电力供应，雷达室将不能正常运作。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"我们的雷达碟形设施不是位于基地内部，使用主动雷达不会让敌人直接发现我们的基地。不过考虑到其他军用雷达也采用同样的技术，或许外星飞船能够学会如何通过路径分析来找到目标。最大的可能是它们可以分析出基地的大致范围。\n"
"\n"
"不管怎样，任何UFO对这个范围地区的巡逻都有可能试图发现我们。所以，在任何情况下，都应该阻止它们。\n"
"\n"
"在基地被攻击的时候，雷达室将会很危险。这是我们的眼睛和耳朵。没有雷达室的工作，我们将无法看到飞碟而做出反应。如果有异形位于雷达室，它们几乎肯定会试图破坏或摧毁整个雷达系统。我们决不能让这种情况发生。\n"

"注解\n"
"\n"
"增注，执行干事霍华德少尉，18 三月 2084：\n"
"\n"
"我们不应该考虑将雷达作为侦测UFO的最终解决方案，即时扩充侦测覆盖范围也是不可靠的。任何阻止那些杂种的机会都有可能让我们获得新的科学技术来提高我们的侦测技术。"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets nearby.\n"

It is designed for the production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these nightmare scenarios.\n"

"The Antimatter Storage facility is designed to safely store antimatter for later use, at least as safely as antimatter can possibly be stored. It is based around an advanced magnetic containment system we've derived from alien antimatter technology, which we call the 'inner shell'. The 'outer shell' consists of several radiation airlocks over the main passages, a heavily-armoured control room, and a host of other security and containment measures -- all designed to keep any radiation inside the outer shell.\n"
"\n"
"The outer shell's design borrows heavily from that of UN nuclear ammo dumps. In case of problems in the inner shell, there's an automatic security system which will lock down the instant containment drops below safe levels. The facility will first close its blast doors, then secure every airlock with tungsten locking rods, fill the outer shell atmosphere with radiation-retardant gas and inject anti-shock foam behind the walls, and then try to contain the inevitable blast.\n"
"\n"
"This procedure will not give any personnel caught inside time to escape, but that's the price we'll have to pay if we want to have a chance of saving the entire base.\n"
"\n"
"To understand how dangerous this facility really is, building an Antimatter Storage at one of our bases will require us to list that base with the UN nuclear site register. At full capacity -- 10 grammes of antimatter -- just one storage facility will be containing the equivalent of nearly half a megaton of TNT. While this isn't much compared to modern thermonuclear weapons, it's enough to turn the entire base and everything inside to cinders in less than a second. It's difficult to 'blow up' antimatter, but under the wrong circumstances, it can happen.\n"
"\n"
"Even if no explosion occurs, a loss of containment would result in the annihilation of the stored antimatter with the normal matter of the containment system. If there were any fault or damage in the outer shell at this point, then the ensuing blast of gamma radiation and high-speed particles would escape and strip the area clean of life. The base would be poisoned and rendered uninhabitable for centuries to come.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"I believe I've already stressed that this facility must be the most heavily-defended building in any PHALANX base, taking priority even over the Command Centre. Losing the CC would be a blow, but it can be rebuilt. The cost would be a trifle compared to the kind of armageddon that can result from a mishap at the Antimatter Storage.\n"
"\n"
"Although this facility will be essential to our continued success in this war, it's going to be very expensive to build and operate due to the advanced tech and materials required. It may be necessary to hold off on building one until we're sure our budget can stretch that far.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, until we manage to build one of these facilities, we'll be completely unable to store or use any recovered antimatter. We can't just build up a pile of unstable, alien, possibly-damaged tanks of nuclear-level explosive. Everything we find will have to be destroyed for safety.\n"

"要理解这是多么危险的设施，每建立一个反物质仓库都要到联合国国际原子能机构注册。一个仓库最大容量是10克反物质，这就相当于近50万吨TNT炸药。虽然这和现代核武器没法比，但也足以把整个基地毁于一旦。虽然很难'炸'反物质，但在错误的情况下，它还是可能会发生的。\n"

"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"

"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"

"Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
"\n"
"Filed: 04 November 2026\n"
"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium wing mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, Commander al-Kuhar of the air wing insists that our pilots can handle it, and I think I believe him. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing on my own authority.\n"
"\n"
"This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it."

"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"我很高兴向大家报告，我们下一代迎击机的原型机已经造好了，并且通过了所有的飞行测试。可以夸大其词的说这是人类历史最好的产品。\n"
"\n"
"蜻蜓级是一种单座空中战斗机，具有垂直起降能力，可以在小型机场起飞降落。即时在超音速的时候，巨大的高性能涡轮风扇发动机也可以360度全回旋。发动机进气口有先进的空气输送系统，前部的空气过滤器可以过滤任何会损害涡轮风扇的杂物。所带燃料可以让航空机在空中悬停长达2个小时。\n"
"\n"
"外形很像直升机，可以欺骗敌人误以为它的飞行速度不快。蜻蜓级的紧凑机身必要时能在很短的时间内加速到2马赫，它的巡航速度是1.3马赫，最高速度是2.1马赫。蜻蜓级的这些性能远远超出了一般的军用喷气式战斗机。\n"
"\n"
"在空中，经验丰富的飞行员可以把它驾驭的像兔子一样灵活。他可以横向移动6秒，同时还能保持其机头机炮一直都对准目标。在被隐形飞机导弹锁定的时候需要0.3秒就可以完成翻转动作。\n"
"\n"
"导弹发射器安装在外翼两侧。蜻蜓级还具有强大的电子作战能力，在其鼻子部位安装有美国最先进的传感器组件，其中包括--并不限于--激光探测器、先进的雷达系统、光学成像器等等，性能不亚于任何间谍卫星。小型ECM发射器排放在整个机身，必要时可以放出干扰碎片摆脱导弹的锁定。武器挂载可以挂载各种武器，其电子模块还可以升级。请记住，这个部位是非常昂贵的。\n"
"\n"
"VO-36发动机需要消耗大量的燃料，但蜻蜓级的容量并不大。其最大有效作战范围不超过2000公里。不过，在这个半径以内，将是这个战斗机的天下。\n"
"\n"
"请注意，正因为它的性能卓越，不建议让新手飞行员驾驶。其反应速度可能跟不上飞机的变化速度。\n"
"\n"
"蜻蜓级需要一个小型机用平台来存储，维护和部署。它有3个武器挂载。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"蜻蜓级是理想的短程迎击机，可以对付威胁PHALANX基地的目标。它可以近距离的打赢任何地球上的目标。蜻蜓级不能追踪距离超过2000公里的目标，它没有那么多的燃料。空中加油可能可以延长作战半径，但那需要更多的研究。\n"
"\n"
"能不能对抗外星飞船不好说，当然这是我们设计的最好的。如果有生之年遇到一个真正的外星威胁而我们的蜻蜓级无法对抗的话，那么人类可就真正麻烦了。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"注解\n"
"\n"
"增注：司令官保罗纳瓦拉，18 三月 2084\n"
"\n"
"长官，我只是看了一下这个蜻蜓级设计方案，他们太厉害了。很难相信，这样的设计发生在2026年--直到今天也没人给他们什么金牌。这是我们可以自行建造的航空机，它可以轻松的攻击直升机，还能和最先进的战斗机进行对抗。现代航空机都不能梦想做到这一点。\n"
"\n"
"由于其固有的不稳定性，特别是在速度方面，会带来一些麻烦。原始档案的部分资料有些不详细。不过，长官，空军司令官萨巴阿库汗认为我们的飞行员可以处理这个问题。很幸运，我们已经设法找到了一架完整的原型机，现在正在调试。我已经开始着手全面改装和测试。\n"

"\n"
"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"\n"
"很显然，一流的蜻蜓级迎击机很了不起，但并不能满足我们的需要。我们必须随时作好准备，以保卫我们的星球和我们的人民。蜻蜓级的作战范围太有限，而且速度也不够快，特别是相对于我们可能发现的UFO而言。\n"
"\n"
"现在世界上只有一种航空机可以填补我们的空缺。阿根廷KB－550，在北约代码里又称“伊斯兰”，融合了老式新式的隐身技术，外形如同老早的SR－71，黑色的机身涂满了辐射吸收涂料，隐形效果可以让普通雷达和激光探测以及其他大多数探测都无法追踪它。它的机身几乎完全由碳纳米管和石墨增强塑料制造，耐热性足以应付4倍音速巡航。伊斯兰级是如今最快的军用飞机。\n"
"\n"
"伊斯兰的作战范围很广。其巨大的燃料舱和惊人的燃油率可以让它在10000公里范围内高速作战。它的隐身设计以及坚固的机身可以让它与UFO相对抗。而且它的耐用性很高，只要有一个引擎还能用它就可以飞行。由于其发动机和额外推进器位于腹部，它可以垂直起飞，这很适合我们的机用平台。\n"
"\n"
"它的电子套件也同样令人印象深刻。配备有最先进火力控制系统，先进的雷达和激光系统，先进的ECM设备，虚拟成像头盔等等。伊斯兰级比蜻蜓级能多携带约两倍左右的配件装置。\n"
"\n"
"缺点就是，租赁和维护的花费极高，机身的重量削弱了它的作战能力。伊斯兰级的武器挂载点不如蜻蜓级，而且也没有蜻蜓级那么灵活。尽管采用了矢量推力技术和变形机翼等技术，伊斯兰级还是如同大型飞机一样所很多限制，这意味着它会比蜻蜓级更容易受到UFO的攻击伤害。\n"
"\n"
"伊斯兰级需要大型机用平台来存储，维护和部署。它的腹部有2个武器挂载槽。\n"

"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"伊斯兰级是一种远距离拦截UFO的迎击机。我们迄今为止观察到UFO在大气层以内速度会明显比在外太空慢的多。这给了PHALANX抓住它们的机会。\n"

"同样，伊斯兰级对抗UFO也没有真正的实战测试。但是，数量优势还是有效的，只要有足够多的航空机应该可以打击外星飞船。\n"

msgid "Commander, I'm extremely proud to present you with the plans for our new interceptor, the Dragon. As you can see we've taken more than one page out of the aliens' book and the radical styling truly pays off.\n"
"\n"
"Incorporating new technologies from the ground up, the Dragon consists of an inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer skin of carbon nanotube-reinforced plastics. This allows it to mount two actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-fighting mobility than alien designs.\n"
"\n"
"The three-pronged fuselage is also inspired by the enemy, slicing through the air with remarkable grace. The upper two prongs can mount small retractable weapons, the bottom prong contains a medium-sized weapon compartment, and the central structure was designed to accommodate the main hardpoint -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the Dragon was named.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we can't afford to spend it on anything but our airfleet. That's why we should be careful about where we deploy the Dragon, and consider whether or not its deployment is really necessary in any given situation.\n"
"\n"
"Also, please note that while the Dragon is technically capable of entering orbit on its own steam, it has no space capabilities and should not be pushed above the upper atmosphere under any circumstances. Some things are just too much to ask right now. We're engineers, Commander, not wizards.\n"

msgid "Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"It's not as manouverable as some UFOs we've observed, but it's certainly fast, with a tough airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to compensate for the increased heat output of the chunky antimatter engines. It mounts a single weapon system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a gunner and an electronics officer. The Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have, however, is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective in air engagements.\n"
"\n"
"Combined with our work on UFO theory, the analysis of the Fighter has led us to some new conclusions about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster than most things in Earth's sky, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull materials, they could easily stand more engine stresses if required. The aliens could certainly build more powerful engines with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are very small and very heavily armoured. Obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to lose containment, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm other craft in the same formation. This might not be true for larger craft, however.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"结合我们的UFO理论，分析这个战斗型UFO让我们对这些小型UFO有了新的认识。尽管这些UFO在地球上速度很快，但还是没有那些配备反物质推进器的速度快。这和船体材料无关，这种船体完全可以适应更高的速度。现在看来主要原因是受燃料输送系统影响。\n"

msgid "Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and up to 12 aliens in a small passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo we've recovered from the hold. Unlike other UFOs we've seen, the Supply Ship is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't manoeuver very well, its engines are weak by comparison, and its airframe will break up easily when hit. This is why a Supply Ship will often be protected by a large screen of Fighter UFOs, in case of interception.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and other supplies from the alien homeworld to Earth in support of alien operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if we can prevent any Supply Ships from reaching an existing alien strongpoint, we may be able to starve it out for a while before sending in troops. This may give us a crucial tactical advantage.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"Because Supply Ships are likely to have escorts, it's recommended that we only engage them with overwhelming force. That's all, Commander.\n"

"\n"

"外星货船到地球上来一定会加强和补给它们的军事力量，以便它们更好的在地球上活动。所以我们应该不惜一切代价去阻止它们。如果异形在地球上建立起永久设施那就会极端危险。在地球上的异形肯定会给我们带来许多危险，这是很明显的。补给船活动的地区就可能表明异形正在建设它们的设施，更糟糕的情况可能是它们的设施已经建设好了。\n"

msgid "Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien medical technology. It makes only a few concessions to air combat. Its main purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry out hideous operations on human victims.\n"
"\n"
"Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood transfusion banks -- are geared towards the capture and alteration of complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem to be used to store some kind of heavy alien robot or cargo equipped with tank treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these robots in place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of air-drop mechanism as well.\n"
"\n"
"It's difficult to speculate exactly what exactly goes on in these UFOs with regards to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with the alien harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for that which do not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to suspect that the Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity on Earth. Something has changed. Until we fully understand what's happening, we need to prepare ourselves for what could be the worst threat to the global population we've ever seen.\n"
"\n"
"In the air the Corrupter's performance is relatively poor, being slow and sluggish compared to other UFOs, but from our observations it appears to be heavily escorted and presents a major ground threat due to its large crew complement and on-board heavy weapons. More than any other craft we've encountered, the Corrupter is purpose-built to deliver large alien forces to the surface solely to attack civilians.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, it's painfully obvious that we need to shoot these things down whenever and wherever we see them. If we don't, it's going to result in the wholesale slaughter of innocent people and possibly even scenes worse than Mumbai and Bonn.\n"
"\n"
"We have to stop that from happening at all costs.\n"

"\n"
"对飞船内部的这些外星设备的初步研究发现它们主要用于收集人类生命，尤其是那个大规模血液处理器是为了改造活人。壁龛还没有研究出什么结论，但根据旁边楼梯的磨损情况来看，好像里面储存的是某种沉重的带有坦克履带的外星机器人。天花板上有一些轨道可以在飞行期间转移这些机器人，看上去壁龛可以提供某种空投功能。\n"
"\n"
"很难猜测在这些飞船上到底对人类作了什么。显然它已经对收集的人类做过什么了，但这些飞船去过的地方并没有出现异常。我们不得不怀疑，这种渗透型UFO的出现说明异形在地球上的活动有了变化。可能有些事情已经发生了。在我们搞清楚到底发生什么之前，我们必须要严阵以待，可能会是前所未有的大麻烦。\n"
"\n"
"渗透型UFO飞行性能很差，灵活机动性远不如其他UFO。不过他们出现的时候总是伴随着大量护卫UFO。根据我们统计，渗透型UFO出现的地方总是会有大规模袭击平民的事情发生。\n"

"\n"
"We've dubbed this UFO the 'Gunboat', and the name tells you a great deal about its intended function. Its weapons and armour exceed that of UFOs twice its size. As near as we can tell it was designed for the role of heavy fighter/interceptor, and it fulfills that role magnificently.\n"
"\n"
"The UFO is armed with two particle beam weapons as well as -- very interestingly -- two additional modular hardpoints of a design almost identical to the weapon hardpoints on our own aircraft. It seems like the aliens have actually adapted our design for their own use and may begin using different loadouts on individual craft. If the aliens are actually learning from us, we could be in for a hell of a ride . . .\n"
"\n"
"Even more interesting is the Gunboat's armour, an improvement over the standard skin of alien materials we saw on the first wave of invading UFOs. This new armour is a composite layer-cake of alien materials and various other substances designed to slow and stop projectiles from penetrating. The basic principle is simple enough but the new compounds have interesting properties which we're not sure we fully understand. I'll see if my team can make anything of it and, if so, I'll have a new research proposal ready for you soon.\n"
"\n"
"The fuselage design of the Gunboat is still ostensibly that of a spacecraft, but it has certain adaptations that make it much easier to handle in atmosphere. It has actual wing surface generating lift, unlike the small claw-winged designs which relied on brute engine power to stay airborne. Furthermore, mobile flaps on the wings and stabilisers -- much like on human aircraft -- allow the Gunboat to use the airflow over its surfaces, giving it a much tighter turning circle, a far higher angle of attack and a tremendous rate of climb compared to a UFO moving on engine power alone.\n"
"\n"
"Overall the Gunboat is fast, manoeuvrable and utterly deadly. It seems to outperform previously-observed UFOs on every level; faster, tougher, better-armed and more nimble. The only positive is that it would take three or four times as much material to build a Gunboat compared to a small attack craft and twice as much fuel to keep it flying, so it's unlikely we'll see Gunboats in large numbers. My only worry is that they won't need very many of these to pound us into dust. Extreme caution is advised, Commander, and I recommend we spend some time and money upgrading our airfleet as soon as we can.\n"

"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-priority target. Its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only obvious drawback is low manoeuvrability compared to smaller UFO types. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of the few advantages we'll have over the Harvester, and it would be wise to upgrade our equipment in order to mitigate some of the aliens' tech superiority.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots and craft on any Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
"\n"
"Our estimates of the Harvester's increased capabilities raise some frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. Without upgrades to our airfleet, we may not be able to stand up to more dangerous threats in the future.\n"

"在空中，掠夺者威力很大，应该最优消灭。双联动的粒子束和外星飞弹发射器的火力远远大于我们的任何火力。其唯一显著的缺点是机动能力不如小型UFO。相比之下我们的迎击机灵活的多，而且在地球大气层内作战我们的经验也比异形多得多。这是我们为数不多的优势，尽快更新我们的装备系统将能减低敌人的高科技优势。\n"

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the 'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, but no liver or heart that we can identify.

"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the extensive armouring.\n"

"正如这家伙的体型一样，它的肌肉比建筑工人多得多。我们首先认为这是由于超大重力影响造成的，但随后的激素和毒理学研究又有了新的发现。可能的情况是遗传基因的突变使食量大增从而产生了合成类固醇。再加上令人难以置信的高密集肌肉，恐怕地球上的任何生物都没有Ortnok身体强壮。\n"
"\n"
"我们第一次开刀就惊讶地发现Ortnok没有血液。它有肺、胰脏和消化器官，但没有心脏。代替静脉位置的是一套非常发达的神经管道，里面充满了导电胶，似乎肌肉运动的能量和控制都是直接来自于电刺激。所需要的电力由消化有机物产生的，并储存在位于肺部下面的一个有点像鳗鱼状的器官里。整个胸腔有丰富的骨架来保护内脏，骨架外就是绿色皮革。\n"
"\n"
"它的眼睛里布满了手术植入的镜片，用来加强Ortnok本身就已经很好的视觉系统，使其能看到红外光线。在头部的两边有三个小孔洞，是它的听觉系统，也非常发达。它的鼻子很小，在讨论会上我们认为它的嗅觉器官基本已经退化。\n"
"\n"
"根据我们的分析，我们得出的结论有以下几点：\n"
"\n"
"-大脑和原始人差不多，不会比直立人强，不过作为一个听从命令的士兵这就已经足够了。Ortnok在战场上不会有什么战术可言。\n"
"\n"
"-三指手可以携带和使用各种各样的武器设备。Ortnok往往会配备大型武器，这样才比较符合他们的身材。\n"
"\n"
"-Ortnok很强状很危险。身体结构增强了他们的自然耐力，使他们很难被打倒。建议是用穿甲弹或燃烧类武器。用白刃、激光或爆炸类武器来对付它，效果会有所降低。\n"
"\n"
"-所有Ortnok的尸体我们都没发现有繁殖器官。从腹股沟周围的手术疤痕推测，我们认为他们可能因为某些理由作了绝育手术。\n"
"\n"
"在战斗中，Ortnok似乎是一种用于火力支援的重型步兵。他们对复杂的武器不是特别的精确，他们通常采用密集火力来压制对手，对PHALANX小队来说危险性很高。Ortnok似乎没有其他专业能力，在我们的现场摄像记录里他们从未使用过复杂机械，在没有战斗的时候，也不像Taman一样时刻注意自己周围的安全。\n"

"The autopsy and evaluation of the green alien specimen is complete. I'm hereby submitting my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing we noticed about this species, which has been named the 'Ortnok', is its size. Its appearence is like a brutish, hulking caricature of a man, something that can be quite disturbing to our agents in the field, but we've confirmed that the Ortnok is in no way genetically related to humanity.\n"
"\n"
"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"

"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for 'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it does on humans.\n"

"我们解剖这个新的外星物种--Shevaar--发现很有趣。它和像人的Taman和Ortnok非常不同，有一双趾行动物的腿和一个小尾巴，好像是没有完全进化遗留下来的。而且它也没有眼睛，可以说是完全失明，看不到可见光。然而，它有一些其他有趣的器官来弥补这一缺陷。\n"
"\n"
"首先，Shevaar外形看起来像是人和蜥蜴的合成体。和大多数地球上蜥蜴相比，这个物种是温血动物，而且其大脑的大小类似于我们自己人类--也许比我们的还大一点。巨大的双脚弹性很好，它可以长期以跨越式的步态来行走。巨大的双手也可以毫无问题的使用各种外星武器。\n"
"\n"
"尸体解剖的结果也同样很有趣。切开胸部以后，我们发现它的骨骼很结实，和我们不同，主要成分是碳而不是钙，还含有以其他金属成分。整个肋骨包裹着胸腔内部就像一面坚硬的盾牌，用来抵挡刀和子弹的伤害，避免内部的重要器官受到损害。不光这样，全身还布满了金属肌肉。\n"
"\n"
"大脑的保护也很特别。好几层的金属角捆绕在一起，就像坚不可摧的头盔。从角的磨损痕迹来看，我们猜测，这种异形可能像动物一样经常通过相互头顶来进行某种交配前的仪式。嘴巴凸出但很小，消化管道的结构比较简单。\n"
"\n"
"头部不仅仅只有大脑和嘴，还有其他的器官。在卷发状骨头的后面有三个器官构成的组织，好像可以发现红外辐射。这显然是Shevaar用来代替眼睛的器官。我们的数据分析结果是，这个器官的效果和佩戴标准红外护目镜的PHALANX士兵差不多。\n"
"\n"
"通过解剖和战场分析，我们得出以下几点结论：\n"
"\n"
"-Shevaar可以看见红外光。要想在它们面前隐藏或偷偷靠近它们将非常困难。\n"
"\n"
"-它们大多使用轻型武器以便能保持他们的灵活性。这使它们能够很有效的运用打了就跑的战术。\n"
"\n"
"-Shevaar的身体有很高的耐冲击性，并且不怕切割伤害，它紧凑的内部结构也不容易被爆炸震荡伤害。然而，它们的鳞片对火、电、激光没有什么防护功能。\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar通常被用作快速装甲侦察兵。它们也非常适合充当这个角色，快速移动能力和发达的视野是它们最有效的工具，似乎它们的数量也不少。Shevaar的地位看起来像是位于Taman和Ortnok之间，因为它们有时也会充当指挥的角色，不像Ortnok，但如果和Taman在一起往往都是由Taman发号施令的。\n"
"\n"
"在没有战斗的时候，Shevaar大部分时间都在作警戒侦查或者看押被俘的人类。\n"
"\n"
"在喉咙还有一套复杂的植入装置，这还需要进一步研究才能了解其作用。关于这个我会寄给您更详细的研究草案。\n"
"\n"
"我们应该小心这些Shevaar。它们是快速危险的精锐侦查兵，在我们队伍战斗线过长的时候，它会对我们产生很大威胁。如果Shevaar绕到我们小队暴露的侧翼或后方，那后果不堪设想。即使是手榴弹也不可能一次就彻底的杀死任何Shevaar，他们会飞快的从我们的视线中逃走。\n"
"\n"
"另外，虽然Shevaar是失明的，但还是可能会受到闪光雷的影响，因为它和人类一样也是有一个受声音影响的平衡器官。\n"

"My team and I have completed the disassembly and autopsy of the alien creature we discovered. Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"We first assumed the object was a robot, but upon investigation we found a small biomass at its core. This biological alien core is encased in a shell of sensors which we believe interpret its signals to operate the electrical machinery. For all intents and purposes, this alien is little more than a \"brain\" in charge of a complex device. Calling it a brain may be too generous. We don't believe it is large enough to undertake mental processes more complex than basic motor skills, but troops report seeing it coordinate closely with other aliens on the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"The device itself is a small, but heavy, mobile disk, able to hover above the ground. Because of its aerial movement, it is able to cross the battlefield rapidly. Our soldiers will need to take it down before it gets in range, which is no small feet considering its size and movement capabilities.\n"
"\n"
"The models we discovered are equipped with a mounted plasma weapon which is able to fire single rounds. Anyone caught within range will be very sorry. Given its brain size and limited functionality, we believe this alien is engineered for light combat missions -- perhaps it plays a reconnaissance role.\n"

"绿皮肤异形的尸体解剖研究已经完成。这里是我的总结报告。\n"
"\n"
"这种异形人们称呼它为“Ortnok”，其外观如同漫画里笨重的野蛮人，这让我的助手感到有点不安。我们已经证实Ortnok绝不是什么人类的远亲。\n"
"\n"
"正如这家伙的体型一样，它的肌肉比建筑工人多得多。我们首先认为这是由于超大重力影响造成的，但随后的激素和毒理学研究又有了新的发现。可能的情况是遗传基因的突变使食量大增从而产生了合成类固醇。再加上令人难以置信的高密集肌肉，恐怕地球上的任何生物都没有Ortnok身体强壮。\n"
"\n"
"我们第一次开刀就惊讶地发现Ortnok没有血液。它有肺、胰脏和消化器官，但没有心脏。代替静脉位置的是一套非常发达的神经管道，里面充满了导电胶，似乎肌肉运动的能量和控制都是直接来自于电刺激。所需要的电力由消化有机物产生的，并储存在位于肺部下面的一个有点像鳗鱼状的器官里。整个胸腔有丰富的骨架来保护内脏，骨架外就是绿色皮革。\n"
"\n"
"它的眼睛里布满了手术植入的镜片，用来加强Ortnok本身就已经很好的视觉系统，使其能看到红外光线。在头部的两边有三个小孔洞，是它的听觉系统，也非常发达。它的鼻子很小，在讨论会上我们认为它的嗅觉器官基本已经退化。\n"
"\n"
"根据我们的分析，我们得出的结论有以下几点：\n"
"\n"
"-大脑和原始人差不多，不会比直立人强，不过作为一个听从命令的士兵这就已经足够了。Ortnok在战场上不会有什么战术可言。\n"
"\n"
"-三指手可以携带和使用各种各样的武器设备。Ortnok往往会配备大型武器，这样才比较符合他们的身材。\n"
"\n"
"-Ortnok很强状很危险。身体结构增强了他们的自然耐力，使他们很难被打倒。建议是用穿甲弹或燃烧类武器。用白刃、激光或爆炸类武器来对付它，效果会有所降低。\n"
"\n"
"-所有Ortnok的尸体我们都没发现有繁殖器官。从腹股沟周围的手术疤痕推测，我们认为他们可能因为某些理由作了绝育手术。\n"
"\n"
"在战斗中，Ortnok似乎是一种用于火力支援的重型步兵。他们对复杂的武器不是特别的精确，他们通常采用密集火力来压制对手，对PHALANX小队来说危险性很高。Ortnok似乎没有其他专业能力，在我们的现场摄像记录里他们从未使用过复杂机械，在没有战斗的时候，也不像Taman一样时刻注意自己周围的安全。\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on this big damned cannon we brought back.\n"
"\n"
"We've always suspected that a real alien army would field more than just plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger. Though smaller and lighter than the Plasma Blaster, the PB cannon's recoil is out of this world. It can blast a full grown man clean off his feet in one shot. No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"
"\n"
"As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous steel and blow the target back by several metres. This is usually all that's necessary. A second hit will turn the buckle into a fist-sized hole, clean through. Our infantry armour will perform only slightly better, but deflection will help somewhat.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon's mechanics are quite simple, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"That's all I've got for you right now, Commander. I'll keep you updated on our progress with the magazines.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the \"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be suicide.\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

"在神剑计划的努力下，我们已经在全球搜罗了的适合我们航空机使用的最好设备。一如既往，只有最好的设备才会用于保卫我们地球。\n"
"\n"
"航空机设计的一个根本事实是，它更容易制造伤害而不是更安全。重的东西真的不属于天空，它需要不断的动力才能像鸟一样飞行，如果动力来源被破坏，那坠毁是不可避免的。PHALANX使用的都是多引擎飞机，但即使这样，在战斗中损失任何一个引擎都会使作战处于不利地位，继续作战无疑等于自杀。\n"
"\n"
"添加额外的装甲可以保护我们航空机上的关键系统。不要指望这个可以让航空机能在长时间攻击伤害中存活。这只是减少燃料箱和其他重要系统的被破坏的可能性，防止这种意外使航空器瞬时失去飞行能力。\n"
"\n"
"这套装甲使用了地球上昂贵的聚合物材料。它可以在热量和压力下自动变形，能够缓冲动能和爆炸能量对整个装甲表面的冲击。一旦冲击能源消散，变形板会惊人地部分恢复到之前的形状，这取决于收到的伤害大小。\n"
"\n"
"另一方面，装甲会增加航空机的重量，并降低航空机的飞行速度。快速短程拦截可能问题不大，但可能会影响长距离作战。\n"
"\n"
"我们的航空机需要有模块化装甲槽才可以安装这套装甲。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"

msgid "Commander, I've got some good news. My team and I have finished prototyping the alien aircraft plating project. Our new armour is now ready for full PHALANX production.\n"
"\n"
"This has been a difficult project from the start. We've faced several major challenges in designing equipment capable of bending the alien materials into the shapes we want, and 'programming' the materials to change when we want and how we want them to do so. Ultimately we overcame these problems, but then we had to deal with the natural limitations of the material.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of these alien materials is their weight. They are significantly heftier than modern human aircraft materials, and anything we make from them will suffer from the extra weight. The only way the aliens manage to keep their wingless UFOs in the sky is through overwhelming engine power. Airspeed, manoeuvrability, fuel consumption, maximum operational range -- all these will be negatively affected by putting alien materials onto our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"However, it's a sacrifice we don't seem to have any choice in making. Even a very thin skin of alien materials offers a substantial protective benefit, shrugging off hits that would turn our Polymer Aircraft Armour to paste. During air trials of the new armour, one of our own \"Sparrowhawk\" missiles -- which can bring down most Earth-built aircraft in a single hit -- failed to inflict significant harm to the test craft. I'm not even joking. We've got half an hour of compiled test footage that will confirm everything I just said.\n"
"\n"
"The new aircraft plating we've designed takes full advantage of these capabilities and shows the supreme toughness of the alien materials. The armour can take Particle Beam Weapon hits at point blank range without breaking up. For the very first time, our aircraft will be able to soak up tremendous amounts of damage and still keep flying like the aliens do. I wouldn't say we're quite in the same league yet, but we're getting there.\n"
"\n"
"It may only be feasible to use this armour on aircraft equipped with alien propulsion or otherwise upgraded engines, due to the increased weight and reduced speed and range. Still, even if that turns out to be the case, the new plating will be essential in keeping our current airfleet effective against the mounting alien threat. You and I both know the price tag of new aircraft, Commander -- we cannot afford to let any of our planes become obsolete.\n"

"长官。我很高兴的告诉你我们已经完成了新的航空机装甲研究，现在已经可以在PHALANX全面生产。\n"

"这个项目一开始很困难。我们在设计遇到主要挑战是如何使外星材料在人工控制变形的时候可以弯曲成我们想要的形状。最终，我们还是克服了这个问题，不过变形还是会有一定的自然限制。\n"
"\n"
"外星材料的主要缺点是它的重量。它的比重大大超出人类常用的机身材料。UFO的引擎功率很高，所以才能携带如此重的机壳在空中飞行。而对我们来说，这样的比重会直接影响航空机的空速，操纵性和燃料消耗以及作战范围。\n"
"\n"
"然而，我们似乎没有其它任何选择。即使是一个非常薄的外星材料装甲也能大大提高航空机的抗击打能力。我们做过试验，使用我们自己的麻雀式飞弹对试验模型进行了一次攻击，结果试验模型飞机安然无恙。我不是在开玩笑，有试验录像可以证明我刚才所说的。\n"
"\n"
"新的航空机装甲我们设计的时候充分发挥了外星材料的韧性强度。装甲甚至可以承受粒子束武器的攻击。这是我们航空机第一次可以像UFO一样能在被击中后还继续飞行。我不是说我们的航空机可以达到UFO的水平，但我们对未来充满了信心。\n"
"\n"
"这个外星材料装甲只能用在配备有新式引擎或外星引擎的航空机上，毕竟这个重量对于老式引擎来说还是太重了。你我都知道新航空机的价格不菲，长官，我们最好不要在航空机上有任何损失，安装外星材料装甲的价格远远低于航空机的价格。\n"

msgid "Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"

"\n"
"现在唯一的问题是该系统计算UFO探测范围以外的地点的时候， 需要一个详细的星际坐标图。 可我们从来没有发现我们收回的任何UFO上有这个。 也许只有UFO的超光速装置才有数据， 超光速航行肯定要星际坐标图。\n"
"\n"
"相反， 我们迄今已经收回的导航装置里含有大量详细的太阳系数据资料。 各个行星及其卫星的表面地图， （里面还包括一个我们以前从未发现的冥王星卫星） 小行星带每块石头的频谱分析， 还有遥远的柯伊伯带， 甚至每个有轨道的星体未来几百年的位置资料。 这些我们自己都还不能完全准确。 里面的任何资料都将大大提高人类对太阳星系的了解。 可能的计划是我们把自己掌握的星际图资料输入到这个导航系统。 但我不能想象如此不完整的原始数据会产生多大的错误。 在我们获得异形的星际图前， 我都不会允许使用这个到太阳系外作星际旅行。 不过在太阳系内我们当然可以使用这些装置。 如果我们能够设计一个PHALANX太空船， 使用它们将大大简化了整个发射过程。 不管是去土星冥王星都只需要按一下按钮。\n"

msgid "Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use them for any applications we might come up with. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"长官， 我很高兴来报告我们对外星动力的研究成果。 我们破解了神秘的飞船引擎结构， 终于搞明白反物质是如何从燃料箱输送到反应室的。\n"
"\n"
"摘抄我以前的报告：\n"
"\n"
"（UFO理论） “外星推进系统是一种完全不同于地球产品的火箭发动机。 它直接采用物质和反物质湮灭产生的动力， 通过往反应室注射质子和反质子来产生能量， 然后引导这种爆炸性的力量传到引擎尾部。 这使UFO有极高的动力， 而且不需要空气或其他任何媒介作反推力， 从而可以在真空中也能自由飞行。 有一个高度先进的冷却系统不断抽取液氮来冷却发动机的反应室， 还能部分减少红外特征。 发动机的能量还用于供应飞船的电力需求。 “\n"
"\n"
"我们已经掌握了这种引擎是如何构造的， 要如何控制它， 以及我们如何来改造更新我们自己的航空机。 我们现在可以复制这种引擎， 并把它用于我们自己的系统里。 不过我要告诉你， 这个的生产是极其昂贵。 要融合复杂的外星材料， 敏感的电磁设备， 还有液氮冷却系统， 这是我们生产工艺的最大挑战。\n"
"\n"
"反物质的储存和控制还需要进一步研究， 但引擎的升级是独立的 -- 只是把一个外星引擎装到人类制造的设备上而已。 我们应该开始着手改造升级， 一旦我们获得足够的燃料我们的航空机就能自由翱翔了。\n"
"\n"
"前面已经提到， 液体燃料引擎和反物质引擎的差距是惊人的。 当我们开始在我们的航空机上使用这些引擎的时候， 我们的飞行员将需要重新训练。 以下让我解释一下。\n"
"\n"
"在一般的正规军用飞机上， 如果飞机加速过快可能会导致飞行员判断力丧失， 或进入昏迷状态， 严重的会导致死亡。\n"
"\n"
"在反物质推力飞机上， 这些问题就放大了100倍。 该引擎是如此强大， 加速过载会把人体压成的血泥纸浆滩在飞行椅子上。 过快的加速还会对飞机本身造成问题， 诸如金属疲劳，细微裂缝和其他机身磨损等等， 这些都需要我们的机械师频繁的作定期检查。 任何的微小的裂缝都可能会让我们的飞机发生空难。 限速系统对此也毫无办法。 大多数加速度都是发生在速度转换的时候。\n"
"\n"
"尽管如此， 只要每个人 --飞行员和机械师-- 都非常认真的按规程执行任务， 它应该不是个大问题。 我们在安全上有完整的规划和设计。 使用新引擎剩下的唯一障碍就是飞行员的再训练。\n"

The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"I have submitted designs to adapt our ground-based installations and aircraft radar, including a new advanced base radar facility. It should extend the detection range and increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs to hide.\n"

"外星遥感这个项目完成了， 长官。 对其的运作和控制我们有了充分的了解， 并且可以根据需要改进供人使用。\n"
"\n"
"我们的初步评估是完全正确的。 外星飞船的探测使用的大多是标准的探测方法， 这些都是我们自己也知道的。 不过它们的设备比我们先进很多。 总的来说， 异形在这个方面和我们使用的是同一套物理体系。 诸如我在草案里提到的， 雷达，激光雷达和其他等等。\n"

"\n"
"它使我们困惑了很长一段时间， 因为现在它的位置在地球表面， 背景噪音太大。 在空中， 效果就完全不同。 我们现在确定了探测器运作的原理。\n"
"\n"
"简单的说， 这是一个重力传感器， 时时刻刻在扫描背景引力场的变化。 一切通过重力场的东西， 根据其大小， 质量和成分都会在传感器上有不同程度的反应。 该传感器能够识别这些变化， 不管是自然或人工的物体运动， 对速度和加速度的探测都有95％的准确性。 如果有任何可疑物体， 系统就会自动警告。 它的有效范围好像是特定的， 比如说地球， 但我们猜测， 在任何星球它都能工作。\n"
"\n"
"所有这一切探测遥感器都连接到一个先进的计算机系统， 该系统可以自动过滤数据， 随时根据需要调整参数。 这有助于从一个混乱的背景噪音里筛选出目标， 必要时提高敏感度来寻找隐身的东西。\n"
"\n"
"有意思的是， 探测系统似乎可以直接的控制武器。 这个系统对打击目标和防御敌人都能有很好的作用。\n"
"\n"
"这套系统有不少技术可以直接运用在我们现有的地面设施和飞机上。 它能扩展我们雷达的探测范围并提高精度， 以便更好的发现UFO。 然而， 最大的实际收益是将其运用到我们的航空机， 这将大大增加我们迎击机的生存能力和作战能力。\n"
"\n"
"最重要的是， 这些探测技术对未来的PHALANX外空飞船至关重要。 在外空， 没有地面雷达的支持， 我们将只能依靠飞船自身的探测系统。\n"

msgid "This is one of several proposals I'm submitting for the research and development of new laser weaponry. Each of these will have to be developed separately due to the size differences, power levels and complexity of the systems involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Aerial Laser Cannon is the largest and most powerful iteration of our new laser designs. Like our infantry weapons it'll be powered by deuterium-fluoride reaction, but on a much larger scale and amplified by the aircraft's on-board electrical systems. Several exciting ideas are being considered.\n"
"\n"
"As well as being the biggest, this may well be our most challenging laser to create. Any aircraft cannon will have to reach across several kilometres of atmosphere -- and therefore loads of atmospheric blooming -- with enough punch at the endpoint to cut into a UFO's fuselage. Those sorts of power levels have been achieved before with massive arrays mounted on jumbo jets, but never in a package small enough to make a jet fighter cannon.\n"
"\n"
"The finished product should be able to engage UFOs with bullseye accuracy at ranges well beyond that of the SHIVA cannon, and although damage may be low, we expect that the ability to keep continuous fire and pressure on enemy craft will be valuable in the days to come.\n"

"这很可能是我们的最具有挑战性的激光研究。激光炮必须要在远距离将光束聚焦到目标身上，由于大气干扰的存在，必须要有足够的初始能量才能抵消中间的衰减。到目前为止还没有哪一套大型激光设备可以安装在飞机上。\n"

msgid "Commander, I've just finished my report on our latest laser program. We've successfully prototyped the new Aerial Laser Cannon and are ready to put it into production.\n"
"\n"
"We achieved what we set out to do: create a continuous wave, deuterium-fluoride-powered laser with megawatt-range output, capable of tracking and hitting UFOs at ranges of up to 5 kilometres. Accuracy is excellent, hampered only by enemy ECM (Electronic Countermeasures), and unlike in all our other weapons it is not affected by range. The laser proceeds in a straight line and crosses the distance between gun and target almost instantly. It's hard to miss with it.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately atmospheric blooming is still a problem, and the laser rapidly loses power the further it has to travel to the target. At maximum range, 5 kilometres, it takes 32 seconds of continuous fire on the same spot to hole a UFO's hull. We're rarely going to have that much time to wait for a kill. The ideal range for this weapon is between 2 to 3 kilometres where it strikes a good balance between damage and distance. Average damage per second at these distances is slightly less than the SHIVA Rotary Cannon, but range is higher by up to 1.5 kilometres. More so than any of our previous weapons, the Aerial Laser Cannon is ideal for driving and pinning down the enemy behind a wall of laser fire.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon carries an integrated magazine of deuterium-fluoride allowing up to thirty minutes of continuous fire. Since deuterium and fluoride are both too potentially hazardous to store on-base, and we have access to large off-base stockpiles of all the necessary compounds, we will not need to keep laser cannon ammunition in inventory.\n"
"\n"
"Deployment of the weapon is at your discretion, Commander, but I'd like to recommend we use the new cannons to replace SHIVA guns across our airfleet except for craft specifically equipped for close-in fighting. Anything that's much less manoeuvrable than a UFO will have difficulty keeping hold of the target with SHIVAs, so the laser offers a far better solution with nearly as much staying power.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"\n"
"SHIVA是一个四管旋转炮，使用20毫米炮弹。它使用一个外部电机来产生电力驱动，而不是依赖后座力。电动机能提供20马力让SHIVA一分钟射速高达6000发。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA是孟加拉国在2048年发明的，当时差点失败。2050年7月一项内部调查才发现竞争对手搞了很长一段时间的阴谋破坏。新的原型炮证明了设计的成功。最终所有的主要缺陷都消除了，这种武器显的更为突出。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA对于航空机武器而言很轻，仅重250公斤，装弹后400公斤。射速超过任何其他四管加农炮。火力瞄准只需一个雷达或激光瞄准系统。装弹系统非常可靠，从服役至今没有任何卡弹记录。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA可以使用两种弹药：穿甲弹或爆破弹。前者有很好的穿透性，而后者在能穿透装甲的时候威力更好。这两种弹药已证明能够在一定程度上破坏UFO。\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA最大的问题是，它对UFO只有有限的破坏效果，长时间火力接触才能击落目标。这让敌人很容易逃跑或反击。另一方面，大型弹夹带来的持续火力也是其他武器没有，这一点不容低估。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"SHIVA的火力小，需要长时间火力才有好的效果。不过，如果混合其他导弹武器装备，这个缺点可以弥补。由于它的持续自动火力，弹道会很明显，从而更容易瞄准目标。它的射程有限，迎击机应该携带这个武器在UFO前面拦截而不是追击UFO。\n"

We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of 'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it into mass production. This will give us access to 7-missile racks capable of being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded \"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This is a \"Sparrowhawk\" guided anti-aircraft missile. It is designed to be loaded into the \"Sparrowhawk\" AA Missile Rack.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of 'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, and it's ready now. We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it into mass production.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" is mounted in 7-missile racks, which can then be mounted to the appropriate weapons hardpoints on our aircraft. The missile's range is far superior to any of the other weapons we have available at this time; it's effective out to twelve kilometres from the aircraft thanks to its unique guidance technology. It's also hardened against EMP to prevent it from being disabled electronically.\n"
"\n"
"The individual missiles weigh approximately 65 kilos. A fully-loaded rack is approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow. In these situations, TR-20 rockets perform with flying colours, tearing mercilessly into a target. However, accuracy drops rapidly against faster opponents. Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single round on the target.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air efficiency.\n"

"If the mission target is stationary or ground-based, these rockets will be ideal for softening up any defences and defenders before a tactical mission.\n"

"TR－20火箭发射器这种空对空武器的生产历史非常有趣，它最初的设计目的是用于空对地。这个吊舱携带了共152发的小型贫化铀火箭以及强大的脉冲式发射器。从来没有人想到会用TR－20来攻击地面目标以外的东西，直到直升机飞行员在非洲发现了它的潜力。\n"
"\n"
"当时，飞行员－－飞机上最后一名幸存者－－被三架米格飞机围困在一个山头。他打光了几乎所有的武器弹药，除了TR－20火箭。他试图自杀，点燃了火箭吊舱，火箭一下子在空中形成了一堵墙，三架米格战机当场击毁。幸运的飞行员两天后毫无损伤的回到了他自己的基地。\n"

"\n"
"TR－20比SHIVA有更远的射程和更大的打击力。不过发射舱的弹药是有限的，这一点远不如SHIVA的大弹仓。只靠一个TR－20发射器可能没有足够弹药对抗UFO。\n"

msgid "Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"\n"
"我的小组可以制造几乎相同标准的粒子加速器，而且效果比外星人的还好。这个加速器是高能量同步加速器，通过一个圆圈加速粒子，直到他们达到足够的速度，然后通过改变磁场阵列，将粒子团磁约束成为一个连续的光束。在磁场控制水平上外星人的技术比我们高很多。UFO上的电脑可以智能控制磁场阵列系统瞄准目标，其精确性很高。\n"

"长官，防御这种武器是一个很大的挑战。很少有东西可以抵抗粒子束的攻击。组合装甲也不是很有效，如果是直接命中关键部位，那组合装甲也挡不住这样的攻击。唯一现实的防御措施似乎只有指望误导敌人。我们应该尽快俘获和研究外星飞船的电子作战设备。\n"
"\n"
"同样的挑战是将粒子束发射器应用在我们自己的航空机上。我们现在可以将发射器安装到任何一个中型挂载上，但是没有足够的电力能启动这个发射器。如果我们想在战斗中使用粒子束，那我们必须关闭引擎的反物质动力系统才能启动发射器。这会需要更多的反物质，弹药肯定会受到限制。\n"

We've locked down enough of the electromagnetic frequencies used by the missile's EW suite that we can start taking some action against them. I've taken the liberty of updating our aircraft software with the new information, which means we should have a significantly easier time tracking these things on radar, as well as giving our craft a better chance of evading alien missile fire.\n"

"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"All our aircraft come standard with high-tech targeting systems, but they still have an extremely difficult time tracking alien craft and holding missile lock. Alien electronics are too far in advance of ours for us to be able to realistically counter their defences. Our systems lose lock, get suckered by flares or decoys, or simply get shot to hell by the aliens' beam weapons.\n"
"\n"
"These are all problems that we have no clear solution for at the moment. However, what we can do is mount additional targeting equipment with purpose-built filtering software that our standard systems can't load. This package was specially built by my team using the latest, most accurate data on alien craft signatures and detection methods. It knows much more about the patterns and weaknesses of alien signals, helping to penetrate the wall of Electronic Warfare activity around an alien craft. This will significantly upgrade the accuracy of all weapons mounted on the carrying interceptor.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful hardware installation involved in this upgrade will take up one complete modular equipment slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This upgrade has several effective purposes. It can help to improve the effectiveness of low-accuracy weapons systems on a single aircraft, it can be used in a fire support role assisting barrages of long-range missile fire, or it can be used en masse by whole flights of interceptors to bring overwhelming fire to bear on our enemies at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"Its only downside is that it takes up a whole modular slot that could be used for defensive electronics or other equipment. This may leave our interceptors weak in other areas.\n"

By installing these special but very simple fuel pods, we can greatly increase the range of an aircraft by loading more fuel on board, and improve the craft's speed by allowing the engines enough juice to run on maximum all the way. It also lets pilots make far more liberal use of the afterburner, further upping the speed, allowing us to better compete with hostile UFOs.\n"

msgid "Commander, I think we've uncovered the secret to the alien materials. After some modifications to our Workshop equipment, we should now be able to use the stuff and 'program' it into advanced new shapes.\n"
"\n"
"As I've mentioned before, the alien materials form a 'memory alloy', remembering several shapes that it can change into if the materials are given the right stimulus. Amazingly, the alien alloy can be stimulated by two different things: heat and electricity. Heat is an obvious choice to make the UFO fuselage splay out during atmospheric flight, to provide better lift. Electricity, though, is a new one.\n"
"\n"
"When applying electricity, the alloy responds only to a constant, low-voltage current at a very specific amperage. The material's shape will deform and stay deformed for as long as that current is maintained. Once the current is switched off, the alloy will revert to its normal 'at rest' shape or a heat-induced shape if enough heat is present. The electricity-induced shape takes precedence over the heat-induced shape.\n"
"\n"
"This means that the shape of a UFO fuselage (and anything else made with these materials) can be changed at will, either by a command from the operator or by automated electronics.\n"
"\n"
"This has given us a lot of amazing new ideas. We'll only be able to develop a few of these ideas in time for use in the war, as some of them would take years of research time, but they should nevertheless allow us to build things we could never have attempted before.\n"
"\n"
"Alien Materials should now be available for use in production. Unfortunately, they require a lot of rare and expensive components, some of which can only be found on Earth in trace quantities. There's no way we could obtain the materials needed in quantities that would make non-trivial production possible.

msgid "In the year 2084, Earth is in better shape than it has been for more than a century. Perhaps for the first time, peace and cooperation are the norm rather than the exception. The current state of affairs, however, can only be explained through the brutal history of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of nations around the world. Tensions increased when Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite the Islamic world. Soon after, democratic elections in Iraq caused the United States to lose control of the country, and Iraq joined the Middle-Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over the years as a result.\n"
"\n"
"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six 50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on 15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"\n"
"然而，从2009年进到2010年，大家的目光也由中东转移到了中国。中华人民共和国逐渐开始收纳周边国家。在2010年12月，为了兑现几十年的承诺，台湾作为第一个目标被军事占领了。联合国多次严厉措辞谴责也无济于事。国际社会对这个问题进行辩论，但最终也没有采取任何行动。\n"
"\n"
"第二次冷战发生在中国和美国之间，2012年朝鲜和韩国产生了冲突，特务设法控制了朝鲜整个核武库长达3天。训练有素装备精良的人民军为此突击了韩国，在韩国得到海外援助之前占领了韩国。此举引起了很多不满。甚至联合国也对中国和俄罗斯开始了长期冷淡。\n"

"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-east Asia.\n"

"The Revolutionary Countries:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"

"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their 'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Oceania:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"美国和中国冷战期间，社会主义在南美却欣然而起。美国的经济衰退更是刺激了革命的热情，一些国家逐步摆脱了资本主义的影响。不管怎样，民主的框架已经在大多数国家扎根，通过理想的规划，人们可以首次得以消灭腐败。民主原则与真正社会主义理想的结合引发了新的浪潮。\n"
"\n"
"第二次冷战中整个大陆都通过电视观看了在上海发生的恐怖核弹攻击。由于中国的教训，每个人都见识了独裁和极权主义带来的革命。那些长期在位的国家元首也作出了反应。\n"
"\n"
"几个独裁者领导的国家立即采取更为严格的措施试图在叛乱开始前加以阻止。引发的反抗是剧烈的，特别是古巴，巴西和阿根廷。突然，这些剩下的国王没有了任何朋友。\n"
"\n"
"一个接一个的政府垮台了，取代的是一个又一个的票选站。革命加速了进程，自由的贸易使地区之间更为密切，最终遵循欧洲的例子，每个国家开放了边界。新的公路网络遍布整个大陆。南美的自然财富不再像以前那样被掠夺，有了公平的价格。\n"

"北美联邦:\n"
"\n"
"随着美国经济在2020年年底崩溃，越来越多的美国人放弃了国家前往加拿大，甚至墨西哥。美元的价值下降到了前所未有的地步，直到国际货币基金组织和世界银行出手，它的价位才固定下来。该国当时背负了残酷的改革计划，要求其卖掉或封存一半以上的军火库。为了偿还160000亿美元的债务，关税被冻结，技术和奢侈品都被拍卖。航天局成功改组，加上航天飞机，外层空间成为挽救美国的希望。卡纳维拉尔角开始提供最便宜的太空服务，一开始是老式航天飞机，后来就是全新功能的新式航天飞机。这极大地帮助了处于困境的美国。\n"
"\n"
"北美国家加拿大和墨西哥开始财政援助美国，因为他们看到对美国的出口急剧下降，希望合作协助解决其最重要的贸易伙伴。越来越多的外籍人士参与到美国事务里面。然后，最意想不到的事发生在2042年，墨西哥籍罗伯士加西亚当选了美国总统。\n"
"\n"
"选举十分激烈。通过两次统计选票，最终结果新总统在2042年7月宣誓就职。全面的政策和个的人魅力使加西亚获得了多数支持，他提出了全新的振兴计划。\n"
"\n"
"根据该计划，墨西哥，加拿大和美国将联合成一个北美的超级大国。根据公民投票，这三个国家的多数人支持这项计划，美国52％，加拿大64％，墨西哥71％。最终敲定在2050年合并，建立一个美国占主导地位的新世界。蓬勃发展的航天工业迅速蔓延到整个新国家，尽管在前进的道路上有一些失误，北美还是有了一定的复苏。\n"
"\n"
"如今，债务已经减少到20000亿，生活水平也几乎恢复到经济崩溃以前。北美联邦有这个星球上最先进的航天工业，宇航局担负了世界各地近70％的商业航天发射。它出口大量货物到其他国家，预计在不到三年的时间就能偿清债务。在军事上，北美联队的实力是所有国际组织中最弱的。它只有一支小小的民兵，国防预算也只是国际货币基金组织设定的一个小小的数额。然而，这支部队训练非常有素，能在两小时内赶到该国的任何地方。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"大欧洲联盟:\n"
"\n"
"欧盟的扩张比较缓慢，但是很稳健。它在2011年接受以色列作为准成员头一次进入中东的范围。2017年以色列和土耳其正式成为成员国。同年，几个大西洋岛屿的国家也接受了盟约。现在的版图是欧盟历史上最大的。\n"
"\n"
"继以色列富有争议的成为准成员国之后，欧盟对人权，宗教自由和政教分离的要求更为严格。欧盟也是西方超级大国中第一个正式承认中东联盟的，尽管在美国的抗议下，欧盟还是加强了与中东联盟的交流与合作，希望通过缔造密切关系来减少文化冲突和恐怖活动。很大程度上他们取得了成功。\n"
"\n"
"在2028年，不断接收不少美国移民的格陵兰正式宣布从丹麦独立。没有战争，丹麦政府迫于其他欧洲国家的政治压力勉强承认了独立。在随后的几个月里，格陵兰重新审议是否加入美国的保护，最终还是成为欧盟一个正式成员国。正因如此，再加上原先受美国保护的大西洋几个岛屿，欧盟重新命名自己为“大欧洲联盟”\n"
"\n"
"在之后的第二次冷战时期，大欧盟的政治势力一直处于最前列。在旧联合国对中东联盟的第二次不信任投票中大欧盟是西方势力里唯一支持中东联盟的。在中国内战之后，大欧盟也大力协助中国的战后重建。大欧盟在创建新联合国的时候发挥了重大作用。世界各国在联合国都有真正平等的地位，这还是第一次。\n"
"\n"
"如今，大欧盟是世界上最强的经济政治力量组织。其庞大的官僚作风--大家也只是睁一只眼闭一只眼--使它发展很缓慢。它的局势力量很强大，但是分布在每个成员国内部，每个成员国都有自己的传统军队。军事合作非常麻烦，需要经历大量的繁文缛节。大欧盟提供了大多数的联合国维和部队，但他们也只有维持和平的功能。大欧盟联合军队的问题在布鲁塞尔已经多年没有讨论了，看来是没有希望了。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"中东联盟:\n"
"\n"
"崛起的中东联盟对所有人都是个意外，包括他们自己。它一开始的目的只是为了削弱西方在中东的影响。第一批成员是伊朗，叙利亚，约旦和阿富汗--当时没人会认为联盟会持续超过10年，很多人都预计会由于彼此的分歧而解散。\n"
"\n"
"第二次冷战改变了一切。中华人民共和国已不再是共同反对西方的盟友，它成为一个不断扩大的威胁。巴基斯坦，塔吉克斯坦和吉尔吉斯斯坦加入了中东联盟，以保护自己免受侵略。接着阿拉伯次大陆也都加入了该联盟，期望扩大自己和西方对话的政治力量。没有人意识到他们已经几乎涵盖了整个中东地区。他们的目标很简单，只是希望联盟不要过早崩溃。\n"
"\n"
"扩大后的联盟得到了欧盟的承认，正式走上了国际舞台。联盟有一个强有力的武器，世界上绝大部分的石油供应都是由他们提供的。\n"
"\n"
"该联盟的经济实力随着石油储量减少而增长。制药产业成群结队的转移到这个石油廉价丰富的中东地区。随后的俄罗斯的核革命以及核电厂全球化，更多的原油工业转移到了中东。联盟继续扩大到了埃及，乌兹别克斯坦，土库曼斯坦，以及争议的红海周围。很快联盟在军事上协助新的非洲成员平定了整个红海地区。\n"
"\n"
"如今，繁荣改变了世俗的法律和性别歧视。联盟仍然有独裁统治--苏丹，埃米尔，马拉克，总统和将军--但他们的权力受到联盟其他势力的监督，统治者也不希望走过去的道路。欧盟和其他国家对政治开放施加了很大的压力，但即使在2084年联盟也只有几个成员国有正常运作的民主进程。\n"

"暴力和冲突是非洲各个不同国家的相同之处。21世纪开始的30年非洲各国的内战和种族迫害一直持续不断。这种情况一直持续到几个中部非洲国家在2039年捣毁了臭名昭著的钻石垄断集团。这些国家同时还没收了垄断集团的财产。\n"
"\n"
"这是军事和经济上的大规模冲突。联合国企图采取各种措施来制止战争，但和以往一样没有效果。几个国家联合加入到推翻西方财团的战争中，并经过几年的激烈战斗，他们一个接一个地取缔了垄断集团。这给他们留下了世界上最大最先进的钻石和黄金矿山。他们联合起来成为了世界上最大的天然钻石供应商。新非洲的核心诞生了。\n"
"\n"
"英联邦和中东联盟以外的所有非洲国家参与了反垄断的战争，相互之间开始了密切地合作，根据南美的经验他们也建立一个发达的贸易公路网络。粮食问题也随之得以解决。不到30年，新非洲就完全消灭了饥荒，公共保健也得到广泛普及。在经济上原材料和水果出口全部商业化。就像南美联盟一样，垄断打破以后新的出口价格使非洲不再被剥削。\n"
"\n"
"如今，新非洲仍然是最弱的经济联合体，但它正在迅速成长。它的军队人数很庞大可没有装备精良的武器大多还是美国的老古董甚至还有百年历史的苏式武器。偏远地区还是不容易到达。不过新非洲总是能及早发现UFO，当然这得力于整个非洲有数以千计的探测球和小型巡逻队在打击偷猎和走私活动。\n"

"在2047年俄罗斯当时的总理普里马科夫.卡拉马佐夫完全给予车臣独立以后事情终于开始有所好转。新车臣共和国在俄罗斯放手之后陷入了争夺统治权的政治斗争中，虽然新的联合国也试图调解，可争权夺利的暴风骤雨还是席卷而来。最后车臣还是返回了俄罗斯的势力范围才解决了国内的政治斗争。\n"
"\n"
"俄罗斯的经济复苏得力于他们的新核电技术--特别是中东减少石油供应以后。一开始俄罗斯在西伯利亚钻探本国石油，来解决能源危机。后来开始建造一系列新的核电厂。俄罗斯对此投入了大量的研究，使新电厂规模更小更安全，更重要的是可持续的。新的反应堆采用了新设计的能源放大器。这个设备在2004-2011的罗马进行了全面测试。\n"
"\n"
"车臣独立以后，俄罗斯的'核革命'真正开始发挥作用，可转换90％的能源放大器产生的核废料辐射周期只有几个星期而不是数百年。俄罗斯几乎一夜之间结束了古老的能源危机，核应用变成安全干净的产业。\n"
"\n"
"如今，许多前苏联加盟共和国仿效其他国家都加入了俄罗斯。现在俄罗斯的主要出口产品就是核发电技术。核革命在今天仍然在继续逐步发展，核聚变发电也有了很大进展。虽然俄罗斯的经济动荡了好久，军事装备有些陈旧，但是他们的精锐士兵实力是不容忽视的。\n"

"大洋洲英联邦:\n"
"\n"
"英联邦这个组织了大多数国家的旧英帝国政治势力，在第二次冷战期间丧失了很多权力。首先，巴基斯坦离开了英联邦加入了中东联盟。接着，美国崩溃了，英国和加拿大变得越来越关注自己的世界。到2030年，英联邦已经是名存实亡。\n"
"\n"
"中国的扩张战争造成了印度和澳大利亚的巨额军事预算，给经济遇带来了极大的麻烦。在2035年，印度成为中国内战的一个战场。政府部队在几个短暂接触后轻易击败了印度军队，并收复了该国大部分地区，反政府武装继续进行游击战斗。\n"
"\n"
"澳大利亚和一些东南亚非洲英联邦成员进行了全面的军事干预。经过几个星期的残酷战斗，澳大利亚情报机关才和中国叛乱部队以及幸存的印度军团取得了联系。他们一直给与援助直到2036年。\n"
"\n"
"战后的恢复费用是很高的。印度大部分地区成了荒地，该国政府也放弃了受核打击的新德里，饥荒在人口压力下更为严重。印度开始放弃毫无价值的部分土地和与其他国家接壤的部分小地区。其余的英联邦国家帮助印度进行了大量的重建工作。\n"
"\n"
"重建后的印度最终组建了统一的英联邦，利用其地理位置在印度洋和南太平洋收取通过其水域的船舶关税。英联邦航运由于免费的关税迅速上升到了市场竞争中的主导地位。后来，随着非洲垄断集团的破裂，更为繁忙的贸易使英联邦充分发挥了其潜力。\n"
"\n"
"如今，英联邦国家被为'大洋洲英联邦'。自成立以来它已经接受了一些非英联邦国家纳入其中间，尤其是马达加斯加，津巴布韦和印度尼西亚，扩大了其控制大洋洲水域。虽然它仍无法与经济较富裕的国家组织竞争，但有了自己的基础很快就会得到繁荣。\n"

msgstr "PHALANX和孟买之后"

#: ../base/ufos/research.ufo:5375
msgid "\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named \"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in 2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"

"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"

"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support and the men it needed to go to war.\n"

"“PHALANX”项目最早是由美国国防部于1955年开始的，那时在世界各地有越来越多的UFO目击者引起了多年的日益关注。外星入侵的可能性严重困扰了已经把注意力放在核武苏联的政治家。在宇宙中存在敌对的外星生命似乎非常遥远的事情，更何况在地球的广阔空间寻找这种可能不存在的东西--美国政府会给这个方案一个机会吗？\n"
"\n"
"该项目的支持者花了两年时间来寻求最高权力的支持。最后，在1957年，PHALANX收到了第一次拨款。当年黑色的预算的一部分，就是在内华达沙漠内利斯空军基地某处建设一个先进的复杂的地下设施。这个设施被命名为“PHALANX太平洋作战司令部” ，装满了最先进的设备，并配备了最好和最聪明的设计师来设计如何最有效地打击侵入美国本土的外星力量。\n"
"\n"
"该项目在开始几年非常成功，开发了突破性技术还生产了世界上没出现过的样品。所有的费用，民间承包商都给于了支持。由于其本身的性质，PHALANX每次都要在年度预算中评议，但它的研发成功总是给了该项目继续存在的最大理由。\n"
"\n"
"然而，PHALANX为之准备的事情从来没有在世界上发生过。越南战争急剧增加了军费开支，几乎没有余地再分配给PHALANX或类似项目。预算被削减和文件被烧毁。尽管一再要求更多的资金，参谋长联席会议还是驳回了古怪的1950计划，并称之为“天空中的馅饼”，唯一让它继续存在的原因也仅仅是因为它的研究工作。不多的资金只能勉强保持旧设备和实验室运行。\n"
"\n"
"在战争结束后PHALANX就没有完全恢复过。他们将永远不会再有50年代辉煌的预算。他们提供了一些新技术在海湾战争中使用，在21世纪初由于美国军事预算的飙升也经历了短暂上升期，除了偶尔迸发的创造力该项目就一直默默无闻。\n"
"\n"
"第二次冷战使这个项目耗尽了生命。其指挥官竭力想让他们的航空机在天空中飞翔，但即使发明了人工蜘蛛丝也不能把他们从美国经济的崩溃中救出来。该国陷入破产边缘，每一个“非必要的”军事计划一个接一个停止了。终于到了2027年，离其70周年还有5个月的时候，PHALANX也冻结了。工作人员被解雇，基地被关闭，独特的设备被封存。该项目很快就被人遗忘了。\n"
"\n"
"直到2084年3月9号，一位老人才想起在拆毁办公室时一个盖满尘土的文件里提过这个名字。\n"
"\n"
"孟买发生的恐怖事件震惊了全世界。在宇宙中存在没有诚意的智能外星生命已不再是一个问题。它不仅存在，它还用最坏的方式证明了它存在。屠杀如此明显，使地球各国政府都无法隐藏事实。在世界各地都在播放沾满鲜血的街道上浓浓的黑烟。外国人离开了，没有留下其他来过的证据，他们收集资料，并在救援军队来之前走了。\n"
"\n"
"孟买消息不胫而走，当在波恩，约翰内斯堡和曼谷发生屠杀以后。全世界每一个人都知道它来了，也意识到这是入侵。\n"
"\n"
"联合国持续了一个多星期会议疯狂的寻求解决办法。一个个计划被制定也被否定。这个世界无论在军事上和心理上对外星入侵都毫无准备。现在公众需要答案，没有人知道，也没有人能采取行动。\n"
"\n"
"联合国只能做少数几个象征性的姿态，在安全理事会上，美国航天局从一号二号国际空间站以及在月球上的永久殖民地撤离了。整个火星飞行计划也暂停了。联合国陷入了僵局。一些国家希望建立大规模的轨道部队并坚持应允许它们使用核武器导弹拦截UFO。还有一些人设想了更多稀奇古怪的项目。糟糕的情况越演越烈。直到一个年迈的官员想起了PHALANX项目。\n"
"\n"
"浏览了美国的旧文件，联合国震惊地发现了一个完整详细的应付入侵规划，设计、设备和培训手册一一具在。他们立即决定恢复PHALANX项目，使用它来捍卫地球对付外星威胁。然而，曾经参与PHALANX项目的人要么死亡或是即将死亡。他们将需要一批新的工作人员。\n"
"\n"
"通过一致表决，决定该项目尽可能秘密，在世界上只有最高级别的政界人士和军事指挥官知道此事。公众被甜蜜的谎言安抚，而来自世界各地的特工队正在复兴PHALANX。旧设备从仓库里拉出来重新起用，手册拍掉灰尘后放到了案桌，储存的武器也被重新擦亮。八大国际组织给于该项目秘密的完全资助。\n"
"\n"
"现在只差一名指挥官。"

"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found the cause.\n"

"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien species carries a unique strand of the infection, we have given them alphabetical designations after the source species in which the strand can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit each species, perhaps something that allows them to coexist the way they do.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious to humans. When injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard human T cells. The organism was unable to take root in the face of our immune system.\n"

"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated about any developments.

"This is an extremely urgent report, please believe me when I say it cannot wait for anything.\n"
"\n"
"I've found some disturbing new information during our continued research into the XVI organism. I have reason to believe that XVI may be an even larger part of the alien plan than we first suspected.\n"
"\n"
"First, some background. During our initial analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to appear with unerring regularity. The same result, again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. It didn't make any sense until our recent discovery of the XVI infection in civilian people. I immediately suspected a correlation but wanted to wait until I could prove it, and since then I've spent most of my off hours studying the problem. Now I believe I've found the cause -- XVI itself.\n"
"\n"
"I've determined that all the aliens carry their own versions of this same micro-organic infection. There are differences to account for the different bodies and blood types -- some of these varieties don't appear to live in blood at all -- but it is unmistakably the same thing. We can only assume that the different strands of the infection were engineered to suit each species.\n"
"\n"
"Since all the alien species carry a unique strand of the infection, I've decided to modify our naming conventions slightly, giving individual XVI strands alphabetical designations after the source in which the strand can be found. Humans have XVI-H, Tamans have XVI-T, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"The organism's function is not readily apparent in these aliens since we have no uninfected control specimens against which we can measure the effect. However, given this information, we have to conclude that XVI is more than simply a bio-weapon against humanity. It may even be used in a similar way -- an enslavement device suppressing individual thought and linking the subject into the group mind, whether there is a group or not. Perhaps the aliens that are sent to Earth are all members of some sort of slave soldier caste, or even prisoners forced to fight, like the Red Army's convict battalions in World War 2. At this point we can barely begin to speculate.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I think we should pursue aggressive investigation into XVI so that we can find the truth behind some of these mysteries. We have to determine the true purpose of this organism, what it means to the war and to us as a species. XVI-H is possibly the biggest threat we've ever faced.\n"

There's no doubt that the attackers were humans like you and me, but it's also clear they were using alien weaponry and equipment -- some of which even PHALANX has never seen before.\n"
"\n"
"The worrying questions seem to mount up. First, however, we need to review the facts we have.\n"
"\n"
"Do the aliens have active sympathisers on Earth? Yes.\n"
"\n"
"Are the aliens supplying these human servants? Most likely, it's the only reasonable explanation for their advanced alien equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Do the servants present a threat? Absolutely. Perhaps a greater one than the alien menace itself.\n"
"\n"
"We need to delve deeper into what makes these people tick. If we can find out the most common causes for alien infiltration, our Information Division should be able to devise a far more successful propaganda strategy, which could increase our number of volunteers as well as decrease the alien infiltration rate across the globe. DivBio also has a stake; we'd like to examine at least one live human prisoner in our Containment unit so we can run a full physical examination. If the aliens have bodily altered these people in addition to training and supplying them, we'd like to find out about it.\n"
"\n"
"Director Wong (DivInfo) also asked me to mention that, if we hold off on implementing a new info strategy for too long, we could soon face recruitment shortfalls and increased human resistance as the sympathisers begin getting their word out. I tend to agree. We need to keep this planet together if we are to have any chance against the alien threat.\n"

"You need to read this right away. With your authorisation, we've performed several autopsies and done our best to examine the live prisoners taken on our mission against the alien sympathisers. The results are alarming.\n"
"\n"
"Do you remember the report I sent you about the first live alien specimen we captured? As you may remember, it lost all its intellect and became largely unresponsive without fellows to empower the hive mind. Prepare yourself, Commander: The human prisoners in our Containment unit exhibit the very same symptoms. They do not think for themselves. Their thought processes are firmly suppressed and supplanted by the alien hive mind through a process we currently fail to understand.\n"
"\n"
"We've run and re-run examinations and blood tests on these people ad nauseum, and there can be no mistake. The blood samples are full of foreign DNA. All these people are carrying something in their bloodstream -- a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge numbers, which appears to replicate like a virus when placed in an uninfected human body and rapidly takes over, enslaving the victim to the alien hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"These subjects run the gamut of the human race; there seems to be no preference for IQ or physical potential. We don't yet know how the infection takes root, but even a few of these organisms entering the bloodstream may be enough to infect and enslave an individual entirely. Not even our own employees are immune, as we discovered to our horror when we screened our base personnel.\n"
"\n"
"Our field agents remain clean, thank God -- just think if we'd gone into a combat zone with soldiers capable of turning on their teammates at any moment! -- but I fear we have found one conclusive result. It's Dr. Eisenhower, our Director of Administration. He's been away on business to the UN since last week, but we ran an older sample which has come up positive. We don't know when or how he was subverted or if he even joined PHALANX with honourable intentions, but it's clear he has acted as an alien spy for some weeks. Unfortunately we can't seem to find him at any of the locations he was scheduled to visit. Internal Security has taken charge of his workstation and is in the process of information control.\n"
"\n"
"Things are a bit hectic right now. Dr. Eisenhower's infection implies that other members of a hive mind -- human or alien -- were in close enough proximity to allow him to function at human intelligence. He could have linked up with our subjects in Containment, or a nearby alien cell, or even other infiltrators inside our base. Right now, we don't know. Quarantine procedures have been tightened to the absolute maximum, and we're rushing another full batch of tests on all our personnel. We're all frightened down here in DivBio. My assistant has been jumping at shadows all day.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, our attempts to infect other terrestrial life -- even intelligent vertebrates such as bottlenose dolphins and elephants -- have failed completely. This organism must have been engineered wholly or in part to specifically infect the human species.\n"
"\n"
"We've dubbed the organism the 'EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection', or XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is a complex multi-celled organism far larger than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like one.\n"
"\n"
"Really, what we're looking at here is a bio-weapon of unprecedented proportions. Instead of killing its victims it takes control of them with no option of resistance and -- at the moment -- no available cure or defence. The most humble and harmless civilian can be infected and, with the instant shared expertise of the larger hive mind, become an effective warrior for the aliens while reducing our numbers. When the aliens also supply them with weapons, we can see the true face of horror.\n"
"\n"
"I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish scenario for us. Our troops will undoubtedly be coming up against more and more human opponents during alien attacks on Earth. We may even find people crewing UFOs for the aliens. It's madness.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we must develop a vaccine against XVI as soon as possible. The danger of our soldiers and salvage technicians falling victim to the infection in the field is too great to ignore even for a moment, let alone allowing the general population to fall prey to this abomination. I hereby request your permission to start work on a vaccine immediately. Please, please respond at your earliest convenience.\n"

"我们需要更深入地了解这些人。如果能够找出异形渗透最常见的原因，我们的新闻司应能制定一个更为有效的宣传策略，可以增加我们的志愿者人数并减少在全球各地的外星支持者。情报处有个建议，我们至少要抓一个人来做一次完整身体检查。如果异形对这些人作了手脚，我想应该能有所发现。\n"

"\n"
"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"
"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
"\n"
"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"XVI普查计划刚刚开始生效。每周的滚动式检测从今天上午开始，这里是对计划评估的效能细节报告。\n"
"\n"
"我们的战略是基于当地的医疗中心展开工作，在警察或警卫的监督下由现有的护理人员来做XVI检测。如果试验结果是阳性，那警卫将执行逮捕，并把受感染的囚犯交给联合国和平部队控制。异形一旦发现这个计划--我认为他们会很快就会发现--被感染的人会开始躲避普查，这样我们的缺席数据里就会有他们的名单。\n"
"\n"
"同往常一样有好消息也有坏消息。我先说坏的。\n"
"\n"
"尽管我们尽了最大努力，但普查的数据还是有缺陷。地球上99.9％的人口是有注册的，但是每10亿人中总会有数百万人下落不明。我们所能推断出的数字精确度也只能到千，但需要的数据必须是准确的。这意味着该计划对查明谁已受到感染只能小部分效用，但在总量上仍是跟踪XVI蔓延程度和异形在那里活动的一个可靠工具。毕竟，我们需要知道我们面对的危险发展到什么样的进展了。\n"
"\n"
"好消息是，联合国和各成员国已同意承担普查计划的全部费用。他们负责地方上的所有设备和人力，同时保证人员的可靠以及结果的有效性。每天的资料将免费直接传送到我们的司令部。\n"
"\n"
"还有一点是，我们现在正在通过XVI普查来掌握感染程度和各地区的危险性。结合我们一般的侦测方法，将能警示我们哪里是异形活动最频繁的，这样可以让我们取得部分主动权。\n"
"\n"
"任何XVI传染地区都应该有额外的空中巡逻，我们应该寻找任何企图在地面上活动的外星飞船。凡是在传染区发生的异形活动报告都不能忽略。\n"

"With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
"\n"
"This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"

"\n"
"我打算做的是建立一个长期滚动式的普查机制，对地球上所有的人都进行登记，同时作抽血采样检验是否感染XVI。每个人都将被要求每周作一次普查测试，以确保他们是安全的--如果在传染区那这个周期会缩短。采样只需要一大滴血液，从一个随机静脉抽取，以防止篡改。幸运的是，XVI体型较大很容易检测，我们可以确保测试的100％可靠性。\n"

"\n"
"SUB: Proposal: Orbital UFO Activity\n"
"\n"
"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"Let me begin by stating a few ugly realities.\n"
"\n"
"1) All of humanity's space-based assets have been evacuated after the initial attack on Earth. Only a few stations and outposts are still running, and they have been remanded to military control, with only skeleton crews of volunteer military and civilian personnel.\n"
"\n"
"2) We have just a handful of space-based weapons platforms, none of which are equipped to harm alien craft. The aliens have the ability to instantly exterminate any human endeavours in the solar system.\n"
"\n"
"3) Our satellite grid is wide open and could be wiped off the map in an instant. Emergency landlines exist, but only for military use. If the grid does come under attack, comms between PHALANX command centres and assets in the field -- aircraft and ground teams -- will be hamstrung.\n"
"\n"
"4) There is no doubt that there are alien craft moving in orbit, ferrying items and UFOs between Earth and the alien homeworld, and right now there is nothing we can do to stop them.\n"
"\n"
"This leads us to only one conclusion: The space around Earth is no longer under our control. The only reason humanity retains any space capability at all is because the aliens have chosen not to destroy it yet.\n"
"\n"
"Our shocking vulnerability from space is demonstrated in the fact that we've fought this war exclusively on the ground and in the air. We have no space-planes that can be adapted for combat, and designs for building them are years from completion. Not even PHALANX could create a workable combat plane in time to affect the outcome of the war with the technologies currently at our disposal.\n"
"\n"
"What little orbital weaponry we have is severely inadequate. There are nuclear missiles which the UN won't let us use, and which would be far too destructive to help our research efforts if one of the colossal things ever managed to score a hit. There are experimental laser and maser platforms which are too underpowered to put a dent in heavy UFO armour. If the aliens decide they want to bomb us into extinction, they can just walk right up and knock. This is a situation that has to be remedied.\n"
"\n"
"The only question we can ask about this orbital UFO activity is how we're going to counter it. Until now we've not been able to affect the situation, but with budget increases and our growing reputation in the UN, pieces are starting to fall into place for a new step to our strategy.\n"
"\n"
"By far the most promising idea for a short-term orbital response weapon is to adapt one of the 'space guns' used by NASA and the European Space Agency to launch satellites and -- before the invasion forced us to evacuate our extraplanetary installations -- fire resupply packages at Tranquility Base colony on the moon. These space guns are essentially giant railguns with enough power to send a satellite-sized payload into orbit. With our library of UN research on electromagnetic weaponry, we can upgrade one of these guns into an anti-orbital weapon capable of knocking alien ships out of the sky. We're confident we can convince at least one of Earth's space agencies to lend us a suitable gun for the job.\n"
"\n"
"There are problems, however. Obviously these guns can't move, being built into the side of a mountain, so the target would have to pass directly in front of the gun for us to have a chance to hit it. Since we can't count on the aliens to give us a point-blank shot, this has been a big stumbling block, but we believe there may be a solution: If the gun can't move in order to hit something, the bullets will have to move instead.\n"
"\n"
"The plan calls for development of a special shell that is able to adjust its own trajectory with a suite of onboard rockets. We're currently pushing the UN to let us use a miniature nuclear warhead -- no more than 3 kilotons -- to make sure that any hit will kill. This orbital shell will be large, heavy, and a hell of a challenge to load into the gun, but it's absolutely necessary to give the project a realistic chance of success.\n"
"\n"
"As you see, Sir, these problems can all be overcome, but we need to do some serious R&D and commit a good deal of funding to get it all working. Please lend your authorisation as soon as is feasible.\n"

"我很高兴向大家报告，通过不断努力，我们在收容所关押的异形身上取得了相当好的成果。山村博士的做法逐渐开始见效。异形学会了用二进制和人类的手语来传达信息，他们似乎能理解大多数的问题和指示。山村和他的助手仍在工作，尽量完善我们使用的手语，而其余的研究人员都在集中试图从心灵感应方面取得突破。这很不容易。异形一直沉默不语，我们需要使用大量的化学刺激才能使他们有心灵交流。这种伤亡率一直很高。\n"
"\n"
"但是，我们有重大的发现。举例来说，心灵感应似乎无法识别身份。它对例如“我”或“我们”，“你”和“他们”毫无概念。它只能理解数字方面的词，比如一个或多个，一个人或一个团体。这表明人类的思想和异形的思想严重脱节。这种思维意识不会把个人当作独立封闭的实体。正因如此，在分析会上，我们拼凑出来一种合理的答案。我们相信，所有的异形共享一个单一的思维。长官，我的意思是所有异形。这不只是一种提高团队效率或鼓励团队精神的手段，这是异形社会不可缺少的组成部分。在强大的心灵感应里，每一个异形的生命和呼吸都是平等和相同的，甚至不同物种的异形也是。其间的差异只有生存的物质需求不同而已。\n"
"\n"
"此外，这心灵感应该使我们很难和个别异形沟通交流，更不用说通过某种原始的手语。以人理解来说就像试图和某人的脚趾进行交谈，或者说和自己身体里的一个单细胞在谈话。当然，这提出了一个问题：异形的耳朵和大脑真的在用吗。\n"
"\n"
"无疑，在收容所的异形不在我们假设的在外星世界存在的大心灵感应范围之内。他们在执行地球任务的时候似乎切断了这种联系，在返回以后才会再次加入。这是否是因为距离或其他某种太空因素造成的，我们无从可知。关于这个问题异形的解答也是很模糊的。\n"
"\n"
"长官，这就是我的报告。最后，我想请求您许可，我们继续研究如何更有效地说服这些俘虏的方法。我必须强调，我们需要新的健康的异形样本来取代损失的。在收容所我们必须让他们只有孤立的心灵感应。如果不能做到这点将是一个重大的挫折。\n"

"在异形收容所里的异形越来越聪明了。我发现我们可以和异形有真正的沟通，更重要的是还有希望能从他们那里 得到一些有用的信息。以下是我的记录：\n"
"\n"
"（特性行为）“这几个异形物种，所有的生理条件都说明他们是有智商的，但他们很少有自己的脑电波活动。这就意味着在他们之间存在某种分布式心灵感应，数量越多，这种感应就越来越聪明。”\n"
"\n"
"“现在在我们手里的几个异形，他们的智力似乎已经接近人类的水平。如果我们能够创造一个合适的翻译装置或沟通语言，我相信我们有可能最终可以和基地关押的异形进行交流。或许先由我们的语言学家或心理学专家来建立一个对话。这是一个不容忽视的调查渠道。”\n"
"\n"
"山村博士正在开始这方面的工作，每天教异形几个新的手语单词。我们需要时间和资金来做更深的研究。这对我们审问异形有无与伦比的价值。司令官纳瓦拉非常在意这件事，他老是询问生物工程部是否可以从异形那里问出他们的科学理论。\n"
"\n"
"长官，请尽快批准这一研究计划。\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"概况\n"
"\n"
"孟买事件让我们清楚的认识到他们的技术是如此的先进。英联邦军队根本对它们构成不了威胁，他们损失了三个营才只是让异形停止了脚步。PHALANX要获得胜利必须使用人类技术最高的产品。\n"
"\n"
"神剑计划的设立不仅是为了找到合适的武器来攻打外星力量，同时也为了寻找一些其他对战斗有利的工具来帮助我们的士兵完成他们的任务。这些都是为了提高士兵的作战能力和生存能力。\n"
"\n"
"英国的SA－3000GPG俗称大不列颠机枪是一种使用滚筒弹夹的机关枪，已经在世界各地服役16年了。最早开始于2068年，它就作为步兵连的火力支援或直升机的地面支援武器在战场上发挥作用，有两支固定脚架。\n"
"\n"
"GPG普通型在各步兵部队使用得很广泛。它没有使用和大多数机枪一样的不可散式弹链，而使用的是滚筒弹夹。这限制了连发频率，但也增加了灵活性。作为机枪它的装弹速度是一流的，每个弹夹有100发子弹。虽然这款机关枪是大型武器，但相对而言体积和重量都比较小。\n"
"\n"
"枪体还有反冲补偿和减震系统，这有助于提高准确度，但精度还是无法和狙击步枪相比。坚固的设计和简单的构造使它成为世界上最可靠的机枪。在孟买的表现也令人满意，给部队提供了非常有效的压制火力，甚至在某些地形牵制了异形的小分队。\n"
"\n"
"GPG的弹药是4.7毫米无壳穿甲弹，和我们使用的AR－80突击步枪一样。不过因为点火装置的缘故机枪弹和步枪弹之间无法混用。\n"
"\n"
"GPG是机枪武器里最出色的机关枪。我们的军队需要这种能够提供大量火力的武器。\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX使用的是MG12型GPG。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"建议\n"
"\n"
"MG12将是控制战场最重要的武器。它可以建立移动火力点，压制敌人的攻击和牵制敌人的行动。它是一种强大的中程攻击武器。\n"
"\n"
"最好让有大型武器经验的士兵操作这个武器。\n"
"\n"

"注解\n"

"With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
"\n"
"This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The use of armour on the battlefield never quite died out completely, though it was rendered ineffective in most forms between the early 18th century and the late 20th. It began to find its way back to common use in World War 1 in the form of steel helmets. This practice continued through WW2, and was later superceded by the invention of kevlar. Today, however, kevlar is thoroughly obsolete in nearly all its forms; it's now used only by civilians and police forces with budget problems. Even more advanced types of 20th-century body armour have been rendered useless by modern weapons. New materials were needed, materials to make armour stronger and its wearers tougher than ever before.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Surprisingly, several ancient files we've unearthed seem to confirm that PHALANX was responsible for some amazing technological breakthroughs in the past, technologies that were later adopted across the world. Every attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017. Their technique is still in use today, centred around a device called the 'organic loom'; a large feeding armature supporting hundreds of individual silk glands and spinnerets, designed solely for the mass-production of spider silk.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests. The armour itself is a layercake of spider silk and treated ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, giving it astonishing strength and flexibility. The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Where possible, PHALANX troops should always wear armour whenever they are sent into a combat situation. The Combat Armour should be considered the basic protection no soldier can afford to go without. For some soldiers, the Combat Armour will remain a viable choice compared to heavier, more advanced armours due to the freedom of movement it provides. Snipers and anyone else not expected to be at the front line will be able to make good use of the extra mobility.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "从喉部疤痕周围的组织生长来看，这个装置是很早以前幼儿时期就通过手术植入的。并且在成年以后还进行了更换，把过小不合适的换成大小适合成人的。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "我们对这个装置的功能作了多方面调查，包括食物预处理或自杀等等，但最后都证明早期猜测的答案是正确的。这是某种形式的呼吸器，可以让外星人能在我们的生存环境或其他可能的大气环境下生存。每一个外星人我们解剖都发现有这种装置，都是一样的作用，这意味着他们频繁的从事外空活动，而不是只在他们的星球活动。如果这些外星人只是来我们这里敌对的外空环境作短暂旅行的话，外部呼吸器会更容易使用而且也更经济。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "该装置本身是一个复杂的过滤器，覆盖整个主气道，同时在两边的脑干有两个小型球罐也通过一个小金属管与之相连。这些球罐里充满了由混合气体压缩成的液体，作用就像潜水员的氧气瓶。这个过滤器是半智能的，它可以严格过滤有害物质，只保留无害的元素通过。球罐再充方式是靠脖子后面的一个小机械脐带完成的。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "球罐里的气体让我们第一次了解外星人所在星球的环境。我们现在收集了一些具体的数据，应该可以用在异性收容所的大气室设置上。里面有少数氮氧化合物，和我们自己的非常相似，但没有任何氧气的成分。如果所有这些混合物确实是某种或多种外星人需要的，那似乎其中有些外星人的生活环境充满了大量纯甲烷。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "让我们有点困惑的是这些混合气体千差万别，为什么强制这些不同物种在飞船上一起生活，而不是采用更经济的隔离方法？\n"

The chance of combat spillage happening during any engagement has been reduced to only a fraction of a percent.\n"

If these materials were allowed to mix, it would be what we engineers call a 'Bad Thing'.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "This magazine contains 7 shells of flechette shot. Each 12mm shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition is military-only, banned for all civilian use due to the flechettes' excellent performance against armour. The flechettes are prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in nasty wounds that will either kill the target or send it running for cover.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This short shell -- only 90mm long -- was designed for pistol-configuration shotguns like the CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun. However, the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun can fire it just as easily, with all the performance increases of a full-sized weapon.\n"

#~ "The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "CLASSIFIED LEVEL BLACK\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "PHALANX Extraterrestrial Response Unit\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"
