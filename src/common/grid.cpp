		 * floor that can be stood upon. If an actor can walk down a slope that is in the
		 * same level, and actor should be able to walk on (and not fall into) the slope that
		 * decends a game level. BUT it is possible for an actor to be able to crawl under a
		 * floor that can be stood on, with this opening being in the same cell as the floor.
		 * SO to prevent any conflicts, we will move down a floor under the following conditions:
		 * - The STEPDOWN flag is set
		 * - The floor in the immediately adjacent cell is lower than the current floor, but not
		 *   more than CELL_HEIGHT units (in QUANT units) below the current floor.
		 * - The actor's stepup value is at least the inverse stepup value. This is the stepup
		 *   FROM the cell we are moving towards back into the cell we are starting in. This
		 *    ensures that the actor can actually WALK BACK.
		 * If the actor does not have a high enough stepup but meets all the other requirements to
		 * descend the level, the actor will move into a fall state, provided that there is no
		 * floor in the adjacent cell.
		 *
		 * This will prevent actors from walking under a floor in the same cell in order to fall
		 * to the floor beneath.  They will need to be able to step down into the cell or will
		 * not be able to use the opening.
