/**

 * @brief Reaction fire code
 *
 * Note that in a turn-based game, reaction fire is a design bug in the first place,
 * causing several logic problems. But we want it and we need it, so we'll have to
 * work around those problems.
 *
 * Imagine the following situations:
 * One of your soldiers is standing next to a house by a street. There is an alien down
 * the street with a gun in snap shot mode (8 TUs). The soldier steps out on street, trying
 * to cross it (and entering the line of sight of that alien). After 4 more paces or spending
 * 8 TUs, your soldier is shot by the alien. Sounds reasonable ? Fine. That's the basic idea
 * of raction fire.
 *
 * Now assume you have 5 soldiers next to that house. They all step out on the street. Nothing
 * happens because they all just entered the line of sight of the alien. The first soldier
 * starts walking and gets shot after 4 paces like above. The second soldier will walk 7 paces
 * unharmed and get shot after 8 paces and the third soldier will be shot after 12 paces/24 TUs.
 * This is because when the alien shoots at one target, all his other targets will receive a
 * bonus equal to the amount of TUs the alien used for his shot. Still sounds reasonable ? Fine.
 *
 * A slight modification: only one of the 5 soldiers steps out and gets shot after 4 paces.
 * Then the 2nd steps out and gets shot after 4 paces as well. Likewise the 3rd soldier.
 * That's because the soldiers hidden behind the house are not among the targets of the alien
 * and thus don't receive the bonus when the alien shoots,
 *
 * There is also a problem at end of turn. Imagine your sniper is set to react with an aimed
 * shot (18 Tus). An alien steps into his line of sight and fires two snap shots, totalling
 * 16 TUs. Then the alien decides to do nothing for the rest of his round. You would love to
 * see your sniper do his aimed shot, right ? But reaction fire rules don't allow that.
 * On the other hand: if you (were stupid enough to) move one of your soldiers with his last
 * 2 TUs out from cover and into the sight of an alien on RF with all his TUs still available,
 * your soldier will receive no RF, due to the same RF rules. You love that, right ?
 *
 * Reaction fire is involved in the following situations:
 * 1. G_ReactionFireOnMovement()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFireCheckExecution()
 *				calls	G_ReactionFireTryToShoot()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFireTargetsUpdateAll()
 * 2. G_ClientShoot()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFirePreShot()
 *				calls	G_ReactionFireTargetsUpdateAll()
 *				calls	G_ReactionFireTryToShoot()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFirePostShot()
 *				calls	G_ReactionFireCheckExecution()
 *						calls	G_ReactionFireTryToShoot()
 * 3. G_ClientEndRound()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFireOnEndTurn()
 *				calls	G_ReactionFireTryToShoot()
 *		calls	G_ReactionFireReset()
